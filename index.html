Well, the ultra-sobering thought of the day, at least for us northerners, is the idea that Natural Gas is sourced from the oil refinery distilation column.  It's highly likely and that means that cutting production will cut that along with shipping fuel of course.  Trains and ships.<br>
<br>
It's a cold war thing like that.  And it'll put even more strain on electricity which is running our electric arc furnaces.  And it all boils down to population decline yet again.<br>
<br>
Buildings are definitely not the problem.  Homelessness is beyond ridiculous to virtually absurd.<br></div>

So many reasons why I feel the way I do.  Having most of my professional software work coming from someone who is 15 years yonger than me has had its frustrations.
<br>

<br>
It's like I'll swap from being practically unhireable to one of the biggest bosses in the world.  It's disorienting.
<br>

<br>
Thoughts in the kitchen this morning that a in a rock band, you have your bandmates as "the guys at work".  And you can even break up with them!  But as president, you're kind of working with the whole nation.  Sure, I can fire a single person on my cabinet, but the "guys at work" is like some kind of endless river.  Not exactly my idea of something I <i>want</i> to be a part of, but the dang intellectualism and purpose of the gig is so strong and passionate with me, I'll deal with all that other stuff the best I can.  Thank goodness I'm totally neurotic and have strong habits of playing hot jazz on multiple instruments at 4am AFTER getting some nice sleep.
<br>

<br>
I have this idea that if I am successful getting a group of young people over here to work with, that they may be people who enjoy getting like 8 hours of sleep a night like I was.  That's OK and all as long as they have decent ear plugs or enjoy wild dreams in a cat kind of way (like always on the guard / looking over your shoulder)....

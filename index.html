Come up to me an give me some cash.  I'm obviously performing music and other things out there.<br>
<br>
Come up to me and simply say you are a fan of mine.  That would be lovely.<br>
<br>
Come up to me and say you want to be in my organization.  I'll likely give you some reading material and we can talk about it.<br>

Don't leave things on the street for me.<br>
<br>
Normally, I'd post ads for my open positions on the Internet.  We don't seem to have proper Yellow Pages anymore and my organization isn't a good candidate for the yellow pages anyway.  I don't know what to do with the advertising for my open positions.  I simply do not know what to do with it.<br>

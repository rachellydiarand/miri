<div class="babyBlue"><br>
Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div><br>
<div class="pink"><br>
<br>
They do lay the mystery on me pretty hard over here.  The last few months, I had some critical thing going on with my throat.  Well, now that is totally gone.  And before that and during it, there was some critical thing with my stomach.  That's gone now as well.  Now it appears to be in my intestines.  That may be even more of a problem, but I'm doing my best to push it out.  And like rotate it out, I guess.  It's odd stuff.  Scary.  I don't know how I'm doing or even what this is or who to trust.<br>
<br>
But it's OK on some level, right?  There is the idea that I'm simply getting old and also the idea that the majority of people in society go through the same thing, but at a much younger age.  For all I know, my brother was dealing with this same thing in high school.<br>
<br>
So, I try to not be totally freaked out about it.  I got confirmation that my place is secure here now.  Like they have it all paid for me and the people I deal with are becoming more and more a presidential team of mine.  It's all underground still, on my end.  But that is what it feels like.<br>
<br>
It's possible that the thing in the pandemic with the rent freeze just got a bunch of people in permanent paid for housing.  I could even be the only one out there with these struggles at all.  As weird as that idea is.<br>
<br>
I simply don't know.  This is odd stuff if you ask me.  I'm in the middle of a laundry crisis that they manufactured for me.  Kind of like they manufactured everything in my life, so it's OK, right?  Everything tends to work out so well, that how can I argue with them?  It's just the way it has been going in my life for decades.  Signing up to be with me is an odd venture.  Even if you just think about me being a transwoman.<br>
<br>
These dating sites are full of seemingly normal women saying they are queer, trans and every thing else you could say, but of course that isn't true like I am transgender.  When it comes down to it, they are not likely going to want to parade around town with me, hand in hand, with me wearing a miniskirt and nylons.  But that is absolutely what you get with me.  Would a normal guy be embarrased with a normal woman wearing a miniskirt and nylons?  Probably not, right?  Well there we have it.  These woman are just making fun of me and the whole scene.  And it makes it impossible to date there.<br>
<br>
And the men do the same thing on those sites.  They really are not that interested in dating me.  They seem to be more into shaming me.<br>
<br>
So, you know, the exotic end of it all.  Shame the president.  Make fun of the president.  Well, I'm glad THEY are having fun, right?  Those little protest ant people.  Getting together for their little work parties.  Well, how can I complain?  They do make some nice mountain bike trails, right?<br>
<br>
Hugs,<br>

Ayn Rand's short novel <i>Anthem</i> can be triggering when reading the first chapter.  Getting past that is key.  It's an excellent book.
<br>

<br>
I enjoy thinking about our future.  People are being cruel to me personally.  I'm kind of a prisoner like that.
<br>

Whatever this is, it is cruel to me.  People either flat out hate me and treat me this way or they are doing it for some alturistic purpose.  It's cruel that I have to haul my laundry all over town.  If there is some logical reason for it, it's cruel not to tell me.
<br>

<br>
So it's just cruel.  That's how I interpret how I'm being treated.
<br>

I'm just being tortured by the thought "What do you want?"  Well, I want donations.  Contributions.  For my EXTENSIVE POLITICAL WORK.  So I can purchase NORMAL things.  Like a sponge for the kitchen and to be able to turn on the washing machine and dryer.  I'm a transwoman, so there are a few abnormal things if you think that shaving gel and razors are all that abnormal.
<br>

<br>
Listening to RUSH's Vital Signs this morning.  It's wonderful!
<br>

<br>
I want to code some software and make some music, duh!  But I have all this other financial stuff stopping me from having enough peace to be able to do it.  So I run around town.  Doing errands on the bus which is a huge time killer.  But I perform my political monolog on the bus and that's pretty neat.  People seem to be mostly impressed and attentive.  I have no idea why they don't contribute.  I've contributed to presidential candidates who did not win before.  Several times.  And I'm certainly in need.  Look around, there are a few others too.  People are just too chicken to give them a few dollars for fear that they will buy some drug or something like a smoke.  Just consider that you may be incorrect and they may be in the market for a kitchen sponge.
<br>

<br>
Here is the house I sold and one that I saw on my screen yesterday.  I obviously have no bargaining power in the men's world.

After reading Geddy Lee's book several times, I then started picking up on the idea here too, from this very first sentance (in the Prologue), that I too was named after a relative murdered in a war like activity.  The Korean war.  It might not have been as obvious as this, but uncle Rand being cast into the Puget Sound or ocean by the boom arm of the family sailboat and then my maternal grandfather diving in to save him and both dying.  The resulting trauma on my mother, aunt and grandmother.  My taking after my grandmother as my by far top role model in the family because of her elegant, clean nature.  My transgenderism is based on this.  I work slacks to high school.  The boomers and the slackers.
<br>

<br>
"Industrialism had an expiration date stamped on it at the factory." - Ms Rand
<br>

<br>
Not even kidding about this.  I'd say it is highly likely that Geddy Lee's and my life have been highly orchestrated to bring this message to you and around the world.
<br>

<br>
I kind of feel like Sting is the world leader in all this and Geddy Lee and I are the North American Continent authorities.  Believe me, I've got some odd and interesting stories!

<br>
Let me try to do this posting again.  I'm struggling for the right words and message here.
<br>

<br>
1. A presidential agrument.  Stating a case.
<br>

<br>

<br>
In order to be successful, I need:
<br>

<br>
1. Supporters.
<br>
2. A good home life.
<br>
3. To remain transgender.
<br>

<br>
My ideal partner is just what I say she is.  Young and innocent.  I don't want some big intellectual discussion when I get home from talking with world leaders.  Someone who can accept me as transgender.  I have some serious road miles on me, especially on my mind.  Someone to love me the way I am.</div>
<br>

<br>

<br>
It just seems like people would want to be with me.  That some young girl would love to come home with me and I'd show her the music and software I do.  The presidential work.  The computer work.  Cook a meal.  Watch a movie.
<br>

<br>
I don't go out.  I don't go out to concerts.  I don't go out to sports.  I don't go out to clubs.  Going out to a dinner and movie just seems so odd to me.  I understand the dinner, part.  I love food.  And that brings up the other problem that I have had like $40 in the last over 6 months.  Like total.  I'm in extreme poverty, but I've made $270,000 in the last 3 years.  Most of it was at athenahealth.  Working with Ben Coate.  You could probably even call them up and ask for Ben and ask about me.  He absolutely knows me extremely well.  He's friggin amazing.
<br>

<br>
I'm simply exotic.  I have pictures of two girls I am interested in, but they are not in my environment.  For all I know, those pictures are a hundred years old.  I saw a girl on the bus today who excited me.

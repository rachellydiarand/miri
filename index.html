As far as my health goes part 2....<br>
<br>
I'm driven to insanity about the idea of <u>drinking alcohol for my health</u>.  I'm a recovered alcoholic which means that I can drink responsibly.  It's not going to "set off the cycle".  I'm highly disciplined.<br>
<br>
<u>But the choice to do it or not is pure insanity for me</u>.  I grew up in a strictly sober household that had family ties to the origins of LSD, if there even is such a thing.  I've been tortured by work people "taking me out to beers after work".  I've been tortured by musicians "taking me out to strip clubs".  I've been tortured by "playing church gigs for the money".  I've played 2,000 gigs and hardly know what it is like to have fans or anyone cheering for me at all.<br>
<br>
So....<br>
<br>
If you, you think it is a good idea for me to drink alchol for my health, then come into my environment, tell me so, and take me out to get something.  Tell me what to expect with body changes.  Tell me why.  Because I have to put that decision out of my hands completely.<br>
<br>
It's pretty much the same thing with meat too.  I do not like cooking it at home.  That decision is driving me completely crazy.  If I can put these two decisions in other people's hands, then I will feel better.  I need the serenity on that issue.  It's the same thing with churches too.  I'm tortured by it.<br>
<br>
My neice sent me some nylons :-)  They are right next to me :-)  So, definitely happy about that!<br>
<br>
I obviously have to do something about my health because I am still living.  I'm also tortured by doctors.  And don't care all too much about my personal life because no one is interested in supporting my professional efforts.  It's a sign, a major sign, that people want me dead.  Of course I am not suicidal.  Being transgender is not the same as being suicidal.  I'm a lovely transwoman, of course!  She also sent a nice camera attachment.  Still need another piece here.<br>
<br>
OK, on with my evening!  Please take note of this.  <u>I put this stuff here to get it off of my plate.  Hand out shit on the street does not count on this one.</u><br>

<span class="pink">As far as my health goes....<br>
<br>
My feelings are that I could go around town, to doctors, and get the same runaround I've been getting for years and years.  Maybe I'll get lucky next time is essentially what that is.<br>
<br>
Or....<br>
<br>
I could just wait and see if anyone calls on me.  To just pull me aside and say, "Here are the facts."  At this point, waiting seems to be the most logical.  If people want me around, it makes sense that they will confront me and tell me some truths that I can get behind.</span><br>
<br>
</div><br>
<br>
Musicially, with the poltiics, it makes sense to me that my solo, mostly at home, show is where my strengths are.  If we hit this 80% unemployment place soon, with all that TIME ON OUR HANDS, many people will want to put some time into music.  Many people will gather together to play in bands, but many people won't.  I'm certainly a leader of people who want to do music mostly on their own.  Those people exist too.  I'm transfeminine.  I want to remain alive and transfemine and continue doing my work.<br>
<br>
<u>Just to make things less complicated.</u>  I see it kind of like acting.  It's mostly just a few poeple doing a scene.  Maybe some extras around.  My stage has been my website for a quarter century.  These fiber optic lines are obviously built to last.<br>

I'm a torture victim.</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
From my perspective, the food I have been buying and otherwise acquiring for several years now, has been on purpose low quality.  I never had a problem before.  Wherever I go, whatever I choose, it's the same thing.  It has torn the lining in my digestive tract down.  Every decision is pure torture.  It's gotten so bad, I have no idea what to eat anymore.<br>
<br>
The good news is that I feel like I have built some inner protection back up.  The acid reflux feeling in my throat stopped.  And it stopped in my stomach.  It's pressed down into my intenstines now and it feels like I am tring to work it out of my body.  I do my best to not burp to keep the direction down, down, down.<br>
<br>
I feel mostly fine.  My belly is making weird sounds.  I am tortured that what I need to do is walk into a church and the people there will just come up to me and tell me exactly what to do and what is going on with me.  But I was rasied as an atheist and have been tortured over this church stuff like my entire life.  I'm simply not doing that.<br>
<br>
Torture too to join a union.  Joe Biden and his likely fake blue collar image.  Better wages for all.  Healthcare for all.  Unlimited everything.  Build more housing for the poor because they can't afford the 10% of housing that is currently empty.  Giving .5 percent of the population a housing upgrade to accomidate the .5% of homeless people is too complicated in our digital age.  Let's just go back to paying suppliers in cash and doing inventory on paper please.<br>
<br>
My idea, you know, as a presidential candidate, <u>my idea is that a political party should follow the candidate, not the other way around.</u><br>
<br>
The idea came up this morning:<br>
Give me liberty or give me death.<br>
Give me freedom or give me unions.<br>
<br>
Not that I'm against teamwork and unions at all.  Don't get me wrong.  Some things cannot be done by one person.  period.  Playing music and coding software are things that can be done by one person.</span><br>

She believes a machine called a "terminator",<br>

Before I joined the Navy as a musician a couple months before my 22<sup>nd</sup> birthday, I lived with Ian who was a bicycle mechanic and then went on to a career making doors.  His first job was welding together jail doors.

My left elbow is certainly stressed out from excessive cell phone usage.  I got my first smart phone in 2014.  My first one was a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 with a plastic screen.  It took excellent high resolution pictures and I code my own software to zoom into them and make selections for email and work.</span>

I used to walk to the corner store which was about 6 blocks away from home to play arcade games in like 1979-1984.  Space Invaders.  Ms Pac-Man.  Donkey Kong.  Asteroids.  QiX.  Mario Bros.  Track and Field.  Tempest.  Games like those.  I love these games.
<br>

<br>
My best friend and I, in high school, would go to the nickel arcades.  Although we had fun at them, I preferred the smaller places.  My dad would take us to the MGM Grand in Reno Nevada about once a year.  I would play some games there in a small room or something like that.  I don't think I've ever placed a bet in a casino.
<br>

<br>
My dad, his brother and father, were avid gamblers.  Card playing and going to the horse and greyhound races.  Although I enjoyed that at the time, those activities did not follow me into adult life.
<br>

<br>
But the arcade games and computers did.  I've never recorded my music on tape except for 2 short experiments in my youth.</span>

My friends and I bought used jazz records in high school.  I would record some of them onto tape to play in the car.  I practically never listened to the radio in the car.  I know a good deal of the early MTV music, but by the late 1980's, I stopped consuming it.</span>

Hello!
<br>

<br>
<div class="pink">
<br>
I'm a Generation X person.  I was born in 1971.
<br>

<br>
I saw Nirvana a couple times on MTV.  Like that unplugged thing and of course that main video they did.  Just a couple times though.  That's about all I know about them.
<br>

<br>
Essentially the newest TV show I've seen is 24 with Jack Bauer.  I watched it a few times.  I saw the Matrix Trilogy in about 2010.  The last movie I saw in the Theater was Men in Black 3.  Before that was WALL-E.  Before that, well, it may have been Mad Max Thunderdome in like 1990.  I saw that on opening day.

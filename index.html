Should I take this opportunity to assemble a Christmas list for myself?</div><br>
<br>
1. An amazing, much younger, totally sexy female girlfriend.<br>
<br>
2. My transgender supplies.  Pantyhose, shaving, hair.<br>
<br>
3. Reasonable housing so I can stay productive.<br>
<br>
4. Time to transcribe music.  Like I'd like to transcribe all this Yellowjackets stuff that I enjoy.  It's only like 8 songs.<br>
<br>
5. An amazing home life.<br>
<br>
<br>
It seems like I have the politics down reasonably well, right?  The social stuff is kinda stupid in my opinion.  Hey, I'm not the jerk here.  Look at Ballotpedia first.  Then the SSA.  VA?<br>
<br>
USDA/SNAP seems to be reasonable enough.  We'll all be on some kind of system like that if my world view gets implemented.  Whether I am president or not.  right?  It's not about me now, is it?  This is federal politics.  World politics.  Food clothing and shelter for people!  And our pets.  Those animals are crazy cool.  I've got tears welling up here.  I can't believe we are born into a world with these domestic animals.  Not that I particularly want one again, but wow, they are amazing!<br>
<br>
6. Time to code software too.  You know, I take breaks from music.  I've got a lot going on.  I deserve a wonderful home life.  I don't care about how fancy the building is.  I'm even fine without a piano and trombone.  Really,  It doesn't matter all that much which instruments I'm playing.<br>
<br>
7. Clothing.  Duh.  Yes, clothing over a mansion.  Like the White House must be drafy and all, right?  Those big rooms?  Is the piano new even?  Is it by the kitchen?  You know how I like to be near the kitchen.  right?<br>

Uh, I was just doing some coding now and I got the secret service comm "jerk".  It's a torture point for me.  They do this all the time.<br>
<br>
So, MAYBE IT ISN"T ME BEING THE JERK, right?  Maybe this is Bill Gates being the jerk?  I have a stupid programming problem that isn't my fault.  Computers are obviously here to stay.  I'm running for president.  My skills are dang important.<br>
<br>
Maybe Ballotpedia are being jerks?  Am I the only jerk in the world?  Am I even a jerk at all?  Because I grew up in an environment with my name Rand and the bee connections and my affection for dressing like Yeoman Rand?  I mean, get over it.  People have all kinds of styles.  Have you ever seen Star Wars?  It's all high and tight hairdos.  All of them are squirrels.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's not me?<br>
<br>
I am tortured by it though.<br>

I mean, I've almost been in tears twice this morning.<br>
<br>
I have to be burried in a list of 1,336 2024 US Presidential Candidates with Vermin Supreme and Sexy Vegan?  I spent decades of torturous hard work to do that gig.  Spent tens of thousands of dollars from my engineering work.  Sold my house to put even more skin in the game and buy another year of work on the project.<br>
<br>
And I can't even get social security to come to their senses on my claim of "Political Insanity, rape damage (physical) and PTSD"?  OK, political insanity isn't in their little list, but PTSD is:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/12.00-MentalDisorders-Adult.htm#12_00B11">SSA: bluebook 12.11.b</a> "posttraumatic stress disorder and other specified trauma- and stressor-related disorders"<br>
<br>
WTF?  What is going on here?  Wednesday 12-24-25?  2026-07-04?<br>
<br>
dj Trump?<br>
Jadey lance?<br>
AI - Anal Injury?<br>
I stole sewing needles in 2003 in an attempt to pierce a thrombossed hemorrhoid from being raped?  A well planned event for 2 months?<br>
<br>
Is it fair?<br>
<br>
Is it punishment?<br>
<br>
Is it a world lesson?<br>
<br>
Is it ok for me to have a $100/month pantyhose subscription?  Is that too much to ask for in addition to a place to live and other things like laundry money and sponges?<br>
<br>
You just need me to stop complaining, write a song, with lyrics, and party like it's 1999 or 1812?<br>
<br>
You want me under more pressure?  Send for to mars?  With her recordings and instruments and computers?  A world representative?<br>
<br>
wow.  Just a punishment for sins of my father?<br>
<br>
for stealing a chicken?<br>
<br>
for stealing drugs that I had no idea how to get legally?  OK, I made a mistake.  It's a business write off, right?  How many business write offs have I done?<br>
<br>
Bankruptcy?  7 years of bad luck?  Bankruptcy the hard way?<br>
<br>
That doesn't align well with "maximum purchasing power".  ( keep reading below for more info.... )<br>

High energy this morning.  I don't know.  Work of course.  Music, politics, some math.  Cooking.  Personal health.  Thinking about how jet engines operate while in the shower.  That expanding air of heat.  How does it push the plane forward?  That fan stuff in there?  Does it generate electricity?  I doubt it's a propeller, but it could be.<br>
<br>
Hmm, the idea that it is pulling on a string.  Pulling the cold air in and it is like climbing a rope.<br>
<br>
OK, I'll do a post on innocence somewhere now.<br>

<div class="babyBlue">
<br>
Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div>
<br>
<div class="pink">
<br>
People like to talk politics about all kinds of social things.  I get it.  People put a lot of work into all these structures and utilities around here.
<br>

<br>
If we are going to ratchet down industrialism in a non "triangular wave" pattern, like liberty bell curve pattern, then that likely means:
<br>

<br>
1. Decreasing oil refining.  This has to be a linear fashion.  There would be less of every product of the distilation column.
<br>

<br>
2. Likely ending residential natural gas.  I know, this is a bummer.
<br>

<br>
3. Less asphalt.  We may be able to get it straight from "tar sands" in Canada.  I've seen reports about that.  It sounds like they are soaking them in water to extract oil from them currently.  There are some other indicators in my environment about this.
<br>

<br>
4. Abandoning paving some roads.
<br>

<br>
5. Ceasing most new housing construction.
<br>

<br>
6. Limited hardware supplies for remodeling.
<br>

<br>
7. Continued food and clothing of course.  The limiting factor to all of this is that we have to keep diesel gas going for commercial traffic.  And we need gas for people to get to the store and essential workers.
<br>

<br>
8. Limited air travel most likely.
<br>

<br>
9. Online ordering of any new products from the "industrial machine".  Local pickup may be a thing, but it certainly won't be the "browsing the isles" that we have seen for all of eternity.  You'll likely need some kind of online authorization.  Electric Amazon trucks aren't massively dependent on the distilation column, right?
<br>

<br>

<br>
As you can see, if this is happening, this is a MAJOR world change.  Population decline goes along with this.  We essentially took all the good oil, bananas, rubber and other exotic products from those highly productive areas of the planet and moved them around.  This depleated top soil in all those regions which reduces output of any new products.  We have this problem everywhere.
<br>

<br>
Population decline is key and my transgenderism isn't really a WAY TO DECREASE POPULATION.  Ya know?  It's just my style of living folks.  Yeah, I do this loopy music thing.  But I do politics for a living.  I haven't made money at it yet, but it's likely going to happen here soon.  I sure hope it is, cause wow, I have put a lot of work into this and if you only knew all the signals I am getting from my life of training.  It is blinding weirdness these stories of my life.
<br>

<br>
Fun stuff too though!  It looks like Sting is having some fun!  Hey, I'm a different person, right?  Go a little easy on me.  I am a torture victim.
<br>

<br>
OK, scones came out of the oven!  Thank you John Kanell!
<br>

<br>
10. Shoe rubber.  Whether is is latex or a distalation column product, this stuff was good for running and better than those leather shoes.  Perhaps the marijuana thing is for those groovy hemp wedge sandal heels?  And welcome mats?  It's also good for incense.
<br>

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.
<br>

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.  That is my opinion on my professional life.</span>

I keep on musing on the Radar character on M*A*S*H.  Perhaps that is the only male role model I have in life?  Not that I'm looking for a male role model at all.  I'm sick to death of male music role models and was never into sports.  Radar just makes sense to me like that.
<br>

<br>
But you know.  I do me and you do you.  It's best like that.</div>

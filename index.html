Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

I'm under high stress obviously.<br>
<br>
I feel like I've been gravely wounded.  I've got this leaky gut type condition.<br>
<br>
I'll likely not a get a tattoo.  I'll likely kill myself if I get fat.  I don't have a problem with eating meat.  I don't have a problem with excercising.  Obviously.  I'm a transwoman.  If I'm going to die, then of course I would just like a bunch of strong men to rape me and mortally wound me in the end.<br>
<br>
Is president Trump building a ballroom for me?  The T2 movie starts off with 2029.  I'd even drink beer if it helped.  I'd do drugs too to remain thin.  Drugs, exercise.  I don't particularlly want to get muscular, but if I was to remain thin and hold my feminine sexy edge, then that's ok.  I suppose there are back tattoos, right?  I can't see my own back.<br>
<br>
I'm insane obviously.  Mosty from extreme poverty.  I used my bathtowel to clean up sausage off the sidewalk this morning and then threw it in the dumpster.<br>
<br>
The things people have done to me are disgusting.  I have no idea how people can stoop so low.  It's incomprehensible to me.<br>

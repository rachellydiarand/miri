Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Hello!<br>
<br>
<div class="pink"><br>
I'm a Generation X person.  I was born in 1971.<br>
<br>
I saw Nirvana a couple times on MTV.  Like that unplugged thing and of course that main video they did.  Just a couple times though.  That's about all I know about them.<br>
<br>
Essentially the newest TV show I've seen is 24 with Jack Bauer.  I watched it a few times.  I saw the Matrix Trilogy in about 2010.  The last movie I saw in the Theater was Men in Black 3.  Before that was WALL-E.  Before that, well, it may have been Mad Max Thunderdome in like 1990.  I saw that on opening day.<br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

This week, I've been remembering that silk robe that I wore at home in the 1990's.  It was real silk.  Very, very skimpy.  It had problems staying closed because of the silk belt on the silk.  It had a wonderful patter on it that was mostly gray but had some paisly patterns made with dots with baby blue and pink.<br>
<br>
I miss that, but then again, my stuff now is even better in many ways.  I hope to get the stuff in my amazon cart some day.  Elected to the senate in less than a year.  Hey, I wouldn't count me out!<br>
<br>
The idea that the Christian right does not want me up there is likely incorrect.  The are likely reasonable people.  Perhaps even more reasonable than than the liberal left.  I am, afterall, standing up for traditional gendering and values.  Sure, my music is faily non-traditional and my zen ways are perhaps non-English.  And I am feminine by nature.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure whether I would have been a traditional male if I had a traditional female wife when I was young?  I just don't know.  And of course, now, I desire a super submissive wife over a husband.  The idea of splitting household chores.  In the presidency, sure, I'd mostly be doing that presidential work.  And it has a masculine feel, for sure.  I'm willing to do that, but it is a stretch for me.<br>
<br>
Always explaining.<br>
<br>
Always working out the details.<br>

It's just how people torture me....<br>
<br>
( as part of my training )<br>
<br>
I just got up from a nap.  I got out my phone and got on reddit and posted some great things.  Then I edited my links to point to my new soundcloud account.  I listened to my music there and enjoyed what I was sharing.  I left a comment on one of my songs.<br>
<br>
Then I reviewed my two TikTok accounts.  The music videos.  The Balanced/FlickBriker video.  I put it down laughing at how amazing my offerings are.<br>
<br>
Then I went to the kitchen to figure out what to drink and I got the secret service message "grow up".  Great.  So I get some feeling.  I try to interpret what "they" are saying this time.  I've got my full length, paisley dress on as it is ultra comfy around the house this winter.  I had seen some AMAB person who had a full length white dress on underneath other clothing on the train today.<br>
<br>
"Are 'they' trying to get me to 'detransition'?  Are the people not going to elect me to the senate and then white house beacuse of the fact that I'll wear my dresses there?  Do 'they' not like what I am giving them?  Do 'they' not like my life's work?  Are they going to cut me off?"<br>
<br>
And it's evening.  I have $33 of food money to last me 14 days.  It's from high to low like that over here.  How to make decisions like this?  It's hard to play the piano when a cat is biting your hand....</span><br>
<br>

<span class="babyBlue"><br>
It's all become too much of a masculine war for me.  I want things back the way they were.  At home without all these poverty distractions.  I want to remove the "transwoman" from "traditional housewife".  I am simply a traditional housewife.  This transwoman thing in public is odd.  I'm a blend in kind of transwoman.  Not an androgonous transwoman.<br>
<br>
I want to be like I was with Ann but without the mustache and the way I am now.  I've never been better.  And people seem to like to punish me for being my best self.  I'm a prisoner of their torture and the walls of my home are my sanctuary.<br>

Good morning!<br>
<br>
I've got a tough intellectual job here.  Doing my best with this delicate torture situation.<br>
<br>
Having greater understanding of sexuality in the "church", but still not having any concrete information.  What I've learned is that I am indeed a transwoman.  If vulvoplasty surgery is possible, like KathyLauren says she had on Transgender Pulse, then I think she is absolutely amazing and I want to be just like her.  Sign me up, but grab me up because that is so insane I can't completely volunteer to get it done.  And I simply don't fully believe her.  If she's lying about it, well, whatever that is.<br>
<br>
It could be a "Where no man has gone before" thing.  If it simply isn't possible to survive a surgery like that, and I'm sure it's been tried many many times, then I feel that the least people can do for me is to guarantee my supply of pink shaving cream, razor blades, shampoo and conditioner, nylon stockings / pantyhose, and pink nail polish.  I'm sorry if that is just over the top too much for society, but it seems like the least people can do.  It's crazy industrial out there and for a torture victim transwoman like me, who is highly productive workign from home, it's insanity to think that people can't or won't do that for me.</div><br>
<div class="babyBlue"><br>
That people would rather I be dead or in a jail cell than to be my best self at home creating software and music all day long.  If people are disgusted with seeing me on the streets, then why not do this for me?  I have a physical injury that requires a reasonable accomidation.  I even wrote a letter to the Skintimate corporation asking to be a part of their team.  I'll work in their factory.  I'll move there.  I'll be their TV sponsor.  I have ideas for an ad.<br>
<br>
They have not responded.  I applied for a work from home, full time software position this morning.  At 4am of course.  I need money.  I am willing to work.  I am a professional sofware engineer.  I am a transwoman.  I'm willing to have surgery.  I can deal with the pain and even urine.  I've been wearing feminine pads lately.  I enjoy that.  Once I have some money, I'm going to buy my own.  I'm going to write a new book this week.  I'm going across town this morning to get dental floss.<br>
<br>
I'm doing my best.  I'm human already.<br>

I'm 54yo.  I've made a lot of music recordings in the last 25 years.  Lots of software.  When I go out into the city, there is always a possibility that I have fans and that one of them will follow me home.<br></div>

Good morning!  I am fairly nuerotic, right?  2:11am now.  Got some good rest.<br>
<br>
The way I describe it is that there is toothpaste tube plastic and there is rubber.  And there is plastic like what my DVD player is made out of.  There is gasoline, jet fuel, candle wax, and the oil we mix with rock to make the roads.<br>
<br>
None of that is tires, right?<br></div>

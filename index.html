Just because I am a transwoman.  "She can't be convicted she earned her degree."  If a parent says that they would die for their child, then from my point of view, they need to apply the same logic to me and my transgenderism.  We are not separable like that.  Deport me.  Kill me.  I am remaining a transwoman period.  And I believe that it and I am relevant to our current political order.  President or not, I believe I am a big part of our future politics.<br>
<br>
I've been going on huge monologs here folks.  You people who are saying that you are "Against billionaires" are not thinking clearly.  And here is why....<br>
<br>
If you are disgusted by Jeff Bezos and his yacht, then lets say that it doesn't exist now.  It's gone from the planet.  The people crewing it and maintaining it are out of work.  The crew that is making the next one is now out of work too.  AND THEY ARE NOW COMING FOR YOUR JOB.  You lose your job to one of these skilled experts who make yachts.  You are now out of money and can't get a job because all the other jobs are taken.  Your family, if you are lucky enough to have one because I don't, is suffering finanically.  There is crazy stress in your life.  If you are lucky, you are in an unemployment line.  I never, got unemployment.  That runs out and then the worst thing happens.<br>
<br>
Your family leaves you and you are on the streets trying to figure out how to survive.  NEXT TO ME.  Ms Rand for President, absolutely.  And I'm there playing my zen whistle-flute, writing political books, next to you, asking if you will carry my bass cause dang, it's too much.  And asking you if you will curate my 10,000+ library of political research images because I am having a hard time "DOING IT ALL ON MY OWN", as my political advertisements have been stating for years.<br>
<br>
What is your next move?  Look for another opportunity?  Hold a sign out?  DHS?  You know, the Department of Human Services: Aging and Disabilities?  USDA/SNAP?  You know, food stamps?  Like how the economy will work in the future if we can't do 95% employment with the SERVICE ECONOMY any more?<br>
<br>
Try to find a cigarette?  Offer me, me, Rachel Lydia Rand, a puff?  Well, perhaps I'd even join you so I can look at the nice smoke disipating into the atmosphere so I can study it and maybe learn something?<br>
<br>
Am I getting through yet?  Is it logical or overblown?<br>
<br>
"Never overblown.<br>
I guess I'll call you Sad Trombone." - Sting from 44/876, dj4, president 48, 1776, 1812^2<br>
<br>
Reach out and touch someone.  Because we will not be having plane flights to your family anymore, if you are lucky enough to have family still alive.  Family who you know better than a blip on your genology chart.  My neice, made my holiday, IN A BIG WAY, by buying me two pair of panthyhose.  $26.  The last time I saw her was on March 2, 2017.  She may be my only family member alive and I barely know her, obviously.  Yet she was kind enough to buy me two pair of pantyhose and I was in pure ecstasy.<br>
<br>
Q: Did men want to shave off their itchy beards?<br>
<br>
Q: If you didn't have TV or radio and your future life outlook was not so good.  And the US Military offered you a $7,000,000 plane to have for yourself and just go up there and fly and do tricks because they want to learn what the best wing design is because we just started flying.  Would you say yes to their offer?  If not, do you have a problem if other people say yes?  What if I told you that we take that metal from the old ships and planes and use it to make advanced cookware and woodworking tools?  Would you support the military then?  If I told you that you cannot make the cookware in your kitchen with that raw iron stuff?<br>
<br>
Hey, while you are doing what you are doing, I'm figuring this out with my little monolog show at home, under duress, scared for my life, but proud to be doing this work, completely without pay and completely disrespected.  Does it make sense?<br>
<br>
What do you remember from college? c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab Cos(C)?  a / b = c / d even?  Does "<b>It's all relative</b>" ring a bell?  From middle school?  Hey, I use this stuff every day, professionally.  Because I am a jazz musician who plays 13 instruments and my music is to unconventional for people or something.  What about this?<br>
<br>
Is it Math 101<br>
or just Math 1?<br>
<br>
(land) survey says....  You wouldn't want your basement to flood now would you?  If you raise everyone's wage, all you have is bigger numbers on the bills, right?  Take it from the rich and you create unemployment, right?  Take their money and create more working wage jobs and you create unfulfilled positions, right?  Just money sitting in the bank?<br>
<br>
Is that logical?  Is software engineering, computer programming, the study of logic?<br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Let me try to do this posting again.  I'm struggling for the right words and message here.<br>
<br>
1. A presidential agrument.  Stating a case.<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to be successful, I need:<br>
<br>
1. Supporters.<br>
2. A good home life.<br>
3. To remain transgender.<br>
<br>
My ideal partner is just what I say she is.  Young and innocent.  I don't want some big intellectual discussion when I get home from talking with world leaders.  Someone who can accept me as transgender.  I have some serious road miles on me, essepcially on my mind.  Someone to love me the way I am.</div><br>
<br>
<br>
It just seems like people would want to be with me.  That some young girl would love to come home with me and I'd show her the music and software I do.  The presidential work.  The computer work.  Cook a meal.  Watch a movie.<br>
<br>
I don't go out.  I don't go out to concerts.  I don't go out to sports.  I don't go out to clubs.  Going out to a dinner and movie just seems so odd to me.  I understand the dinner, part.  I love food.  And that brings up the other problem that I have had like $40 in the last over 6 months.  Like total.  I'm in extreme poverty, but I've made $270,000 in the last 3 years.  Most of it was at athenahealth.  Working with Ben Coate.  You could probably even call them up and ask for Ben and ask about me.  He absolutely knows me extremely well.  He's friggin amazing.<br>
<br>
I'm simply exotic.  I have pictures of two girls I am interested in, but they are not in my environment.  For all I know, those pictures are a hundred years old.  I saw a girl on the bus today who excited me.<br>

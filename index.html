Look, it's extremely abnormal for anyone to be disconnected socially for a whole friggin year doing political monolog and playing/singing music 20/7.  This is a major world event thing over here.  And absolutely political in a major way and not a party or celebration.  Go ahead and celebrate, I don't mind.  But I am assembling a young work team over here.  The campaign side is mostly a side venture.  I want it to exist too.  I have my eye on a ground floor office space downtown by the university.  It would be amazing to start that lease up before the end of the year.  It's totally possible but I'm quite certain that I need these three people with me in this space here first.<br></div>

Good morning!  How was your sleep?<br>
<br>
Still on the end of residential Natural Gas topic.  Going to make a TikTok video on it in a few minutes here.<br>
<br>
My life is not about a sex party or music celebration.  Not about a big Fourth of July event.  Yes, it's some kind of odd gamble signing up to be in my little cabinet over here.  That is a major life event for the people who dare to be with me on that.  It absolutely has to happen on my end sometime.  I fear that there will be increasing chaos in the national/world sector forcing this issue of a few people being with me.  I need this team, absolutely.<br>
<br>
Once this team is with me, things should get good fairly quickly.  It's not about the riches over here of course, but it will be a welcome change.  I need to be the big boss in this thing.  Like for the rest of my life.  It's reasonable to assume that secret service may protect me to the point where people like Sting and other world leaders basically don't come around me much at all so I can be the top person in my sphere.  Do you trust me?  Am I telling you the truth?  Do you think that I have some ESP thing going on with the world order?<br>
<br>
The ESP thing is enough to get the information I need to do my job correctly.  With my team, we can go from business to business on a tour out there to do some research on what we can.  That's a big part of the research position.  We'll brainstorm what we expect to see out there and assemble a list of places of interest.  We'll need national credibility to be able to walk into these places and not get that stupid "Who are you?" crap I've been hearing my whole life.<br>
<br>
Once those pieces are in place, I'll feel a lot better.  And my zen silly personality is certainly so intellectual that I can pull it up at any time no matter what my little situation is.  But you know, high pressure does put some kind of fear spin on it that is hard to recreate.  I'm naturally eccentric.  And certainly looking for a good stash of pantyhose.<br>
<br>
Work culture is here to stay of course.  And the strong man trades lumberjack thing is here to stay too of course.  My aunt hauls wood and drove a tractor trailer when she was young.  I'm getting old people.  I want to slink around at home in my nylons building LEGOs.  You all have downtime things you enjoy, right?  I'm friggin working 20 hour days.  This isn't some drug stimulation thing.  I'm a crazy presidential candidate with a huge task.<br>
<br>
get it together people<br></div>

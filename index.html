<span class="pink">Good morning!  How was your sleep?<br>
<br>
Pressing on with the work here.  I think it's 91 days until the primary election end date.  Again, I don't feel pressure to do a major campaign here, but if people want to jump on board with me, yeah, that would be cool.<br>
<br>
It sure feels like I'm involved in the biggest thing any of us will see in our lifetimes.  Ego is part of it.  If I get elected up there, I am firm about it not being a committee.  Those legilslative positions are committee positions.  This presidency gig is a solitary commander in chief thing.  My Ego is totally strong and totally weak at the same time.  I have no authority with anyone.  Give me authority, grant me authority, then I can act well, but if anyone, anyone I am working with, does not recognize my authority, they are out.  "you're fired" and all that.  I'm totally sick of people pushing me around.<br>
<br>
And because of that, I think meetings are going to be fairly short.  I have a job to do up there.  To restructure this money thing.  I'll be asking questions.  I do not want people bombarding me with information.  If I am not asking a question, then do not speak.  If you do not respect my authority, do not come around me.<br>
<br>
First I have to be granted authority by the voters.  Of course.  This is not a dictatorship, but it essentially is the end of capitalism.  The main problem is how to get people to do things without much of a monetary system?  The main answer is taking control of the housing market.  Eliminating mortgages.  Eliminating rent.  And then using things like AirBnB to redistribute places.  Merit based.<br>
<br>
We are not known for having electricity brown outs.  So that is some indication that immigration is not a serious problem.  I do not care who is living here.  I care about the utilities themselves.  But electricity is not the only utility.  There is water and we do not make rain.  And a decreasing population will not be rebuilding everything we have.  And rubber, natural latex sap, may be a huge problem in the future.  And house wire casing may have a high percentage of natural latex sap.<br>
<br>
We seem to be pretty end state here folks.  And that's OK, right?  We live our lives and die anyway, right?<br>
<br>
Having less children is relatively simple.  The Death After Birth bill can help.  We manage other animals like that.<br>
<br>
OK, on with the day!<br>
<br>
Chow! Rachel....</span><br>

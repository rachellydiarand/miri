Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Q: What does Rachel really want?</span><span class="pink"><br>
<br>
Offical campaign contributions.  They are votes of support.  I can only pay myself $61,000/year anyway, whether my campaign is going or not.  Sure, I can use funds to buy a something for the campaign.<br>
<br>
More than anything else.  If I die soon, to have those votes of support on my FEC record would mean a lot to me and of course I'd enjoy spending a little money.</span><br></div>

<span class="babyBlue">Q: What is being <i>weak</i>?</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
It's like, I'm constantly being pestered by wireless secret service communication "you're weak".  Well, I have had $23.56 in the last 9 months.  How about everyone else in the world?  I have never had a campaign donation or contribution with decades of doing this and getting better and better every step of the way.<br>
<br>
Does anyone out there have the guts to help a presidential candidate or an impoverished person, by stepping up and writting me a small check and publicly declaring that they are with me by submitting their full name and occupation that I can submit to the Federal Elections Commission as a sign of OFFICIAL SUPPORT?  Is there anyone at all?  Out of 300,000,000 people?  Am I really that unpopular?  And that incorrect?<br>
<br>
Have you ever given a person with a sign out any cash?  Have you ever donated to anything?  Do you vote?  Do you look at who is on the ballot and research them?<br>
<br>
It's easy to declare me as "weak" when I have $7.07.  It's easy to say that I am not a good business person when I have $7.07.  Believe me, it is difficult to hire an employee when you have $7.07.  Or go on a date.  Or even buy lunch.<br>
<br>
I could go to the food bank and get a box of food and throw three quarters of it away.  I could take my chances on it being spoiled or poisoned.  I'm getting to the point where I won't do it anymore, because without people stepping up to contribute to my political campaign, I might as well be dead.  That is the signal I am getting from YOU.  Yes, you personally.  OK, it may be a little bit more difficult to write a check and mail it than it used to be, but I'm sure you can figure it out.  You don't HAVE TO USE AUTOPAY.  I learned it from reading Ghandi's <u>autobiography</u>.  Spend some time with every check and payment you make, to consider what that person has done for you.  I suggest taking things off of autopay.  It's a good habit to get into.  I was able to get an 850 credit score without autopay with my highest earning year being $71,000.<br>
<br>
My lifetime earnings is about $23,000 / year over 35 years.  My best friend, and amazing musician, has a lifetime earnings of about $2,000 / year over 35 years.  I believe in my loopy music.  Sure, you can call it and me counter-culture.  I'm not listening to the music you are or consuming the media that you are.  I'm different.  But <u>different</u> does not MEAN "BAD".<br>
</span><br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I just would not last at a job stacking grocery shelves.  That music in the stores is terrorizing to me.  My perfect pitch mind is contantly analyzing every squeak I hear.  My political mind runs 20/7 as does my software engineering mind.  And I have a reasonable accomidation to take random breaks to take a shower.  And now my health is even more compromised to the point of thinking I may not even live much longer.<br>
<br>
And I'd still like to have your OFFICIAL SUPPORT.  I believe in what I am doing.  This is a crazy tough transition in history.  Believe me, if this all goes down, then in a few years, our society thinking is going to be much, much different.  And I'm stacked with skills and stories to help out.  And I just want to do that work and get paid for it like anyone else that works.<br>

<span class="pink">This is was my third time mailing to Steven Spielberg and Barbara Streisand.  I've sent Barbara some of my hand written music twice now.  5 years apart.  Been doing this a long time.  It's just odd behavior that no one will contribute to me at all, no matter what I do.  I'm sick of trying to figure out what people want from me.  Perhaps they just don't want me, right?  They want Jeff Merkley.</span>
<br>
<span class="babyBlue">
<br>
Q: Do you want Jeff Merkley or do you want Rachel Lydia Rand?</span>

Bee careful when you send me a check.
<br>

<br>
Bee careful when you transport to the bank and ask for a single printed check from your checking acount.
<br>

<br>
Bee careful to get my business name correct when you write it on the check "Ms Rand for President".
<br>

<br>
Bee careful when purchasing a single letter or check size security envelope from your neighborhood postage store.
<br>

<br>
Bee careful to be honest about your name and occupation when filling out the contribution form.
<br>

<br>
Bee careful when assembling it and licking the stamp.  I do not want you to get a papercut on your tongue or fingers.
<br>

<br>
Bee careful when interacting with the blue mailbox or the postage employee.  I don't want you do make waves or get arrested for disturbing the peace.
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Thank you in advance for your efforts.  Your work does not go unnoticed.

A musician can get a feeling that people are consuming their work by holding concerts.
<br>

<br>
Actors can get a feeling that people are consuming their work when they get approached on the streets by strangers.
<br>

<br>
Presidents and high performing presidential candidates can get a feeling that they are reaching people when people don't ask for their name when they come into a shop but address them directly.

If you ever find yourself in a situation where you are faint and in a hospital or ambulance setting, or appear to be delusional, you'll likely be asked a couple questions.  Almost always, the questions are:
<br>

<br>
1.  What year is it?
<br>

<br>
2.  Who is president?

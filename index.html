I was running some logic tests on how many votes could be faked in an election and go under the radar.  It's a thing of "did you vote for them?"  If there are enough citizens that did not, the rumors would spread that something doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
But then again, it's kind of like did you hear what the band played a few minutes ago?  Well, there is no recording....</span><br>
<br>
NEXT<br>
<br>
<span class="pink"><br>
Airspace?<br>
<br>
Abstractions?<br>
<br>
It sure seems weird, right?  If all the cars stopped moving and I got the write in votes needed....  If I won both the DEM and REP write in vote, well, people here may be like "YES, I wrote her in too."  And then it goes to the courts.  "Can she win both parties?"  Well, no, perhaps I can only win the REP nomination, right?  Does it matter to me?  US?<br>
</span><br>
<br>

<span class="pink"><br>
Yeah, Timothy McVie, right?  That is how you spell that?  Hadn't really thought of that in a long, long time.  Not every 20 year old can piece all these things together.<br>
<br>
I connect the dots, I don't place them on the field.  Some of them others do, but certainly not all of them.<br>
<br>
The paranoia end of it all.  Tell me about it.  Her about it.<br>
<br>
I was thinking last night that perhaps people can and will keep using Bitcoin to trade household items.  I'm willing to bet it may be more barter goods for goods.  Maybe an online multi-market of I want this, I have these things, other people want one of them, then it prints the shopping list of where to go to do the trade itself.  And I can get a little exercise and meet some lovely people.  And get a blender and pie dish.<br>
<br>
But I don't have anything when the ball fell....</span><br>

Q: How should the 11 2024 US DEM Presidential candidates spend their $200,000 / year?  Salary for yourself?  Others?  Printing?  Payroll?  501c3 setup?  Push the legal factors of running a business?  Campaign or prepare for the job itself?</span><br>
<br>
Of course Big Money is in D and "a lot of useless talk" ends on an A.  What do you know, not only did I sing it in the "right" key, but I also pushed the right fingers down on the holes of the Archon's tubes.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I play 24+ notes with just 6 holes?</span><br></div>

Uh, this has been going on for me for years....</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
I get a SIM card in the mail just now.  The little instructions say to depower my phone and insert the card.  I'm like "I'll need to get the gold bass string to pop it out." And then a like ambulance siren starts blaring.  Their rig is passing my on the street right there.<br>
<br>
Timed dog barks?  Yeah, I'm obviously imagining things and not taking the "right pill".  You know how taking their medications has a way of avoiding nervous breakdowns, right?<br>
<br>
I'm sure just about anyone is "compatible" with me, right?  It's just weird like that.  Amazing of course....</span><br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

If my politics are completely incorrect, or it's just not the time for it, then I'm simply retired.  I have no love for the way people torture me.  I'm just going to be at home doing my thing on my website.  I suppose I'm going to try to force myself to come to terms with the idea that I could be wrong.  I will not play music with or for others.  I will not detransition.  I will not work for others.  If you want to keep poisoning my food, I guess I can't stop you.<br>
<br>
In other words....  I'm OK with being a retired presidential candidate.  A retired musician and a retired software engineer.  I've had an amazing life with all that.  Of course I can't stop the work of it.  I suppose I can lower my hopes a bit for getting political support.</span><br>

It's OK.  It's not my fault.  I was probably born into some kind of Dalai Lama position and no one can tell me.  It's just not my fault and there is nothing I can do about it.</span><br>

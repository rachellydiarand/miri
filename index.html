I explain my position on the concept of "grow up" and my reasoning behind age preferences in a future relationship for me better than ever with my postings on <a target="rlrtgp" href="https://transgenderpulse.com/forums" class="babyBlue">transgenderpulse.com/forums</a>  Lot's of good writing of mine there....</span><br>

One of my little problems over here....<br>
<br>
.. is that with the secret service activity, which is still completely underground, communicates with me wirelessly, without hardware mostly (it's no secret that secret service, like Geddy Lee, uses advanced wireless technology), in a way that creates <u>mixed signals</u>.<br>
<br>
You see, it's all up to my interpretation, at least on some level.  It appears that one of their goals, is to physically hurt me.  To make me scared.  Scared enough to yell and fight back.  Because normally, I'm just very calm and nose-to-the-grindstone about life.  My techniques there are how I have been able to acquire all this knowledge with my 24 years of full time unpaid studies in multiple subjects.<br>
<br>
So, they need to hurt me physically, in a very real way.  And they cERTAINLY HAVE.  But they also need to protect me.<br>
<br>
And this has been going on since I started this difficult journey, like in 2003, but likely even earlier than that and well, I've certainly been born into this gig in life.  It <u>could</u> be some other than presidency role.  Or it could be a contest.  Like Army vs Navy with my best friend Sam Burton.  It could be alcohol vs drugs with me and Sam.  Or there is Jay Collins in New York City with his King's Country Band.<br>
<br>
But you know, they keep me guessing in this gig because it makes me stronger.  And believe me, it's ultra hard on me.  The 24/7 pulbic life for 26 years is OK for me.  I'm way used to it.  I welcomed it in in fact and have no regrets about that.  But this health scare stuff is crazy hard to deal with.  And standing up for my transgender status because there just isn't any other way for me.  It's to the grave with that.  I insist.<br>
<br>
You see, life, health, healthcare is not, to me, about anything to make it to the 100 year finsh ribbon.  Not that I'm a smoke cigarettes because "something will kill you" kind of person.  I quit smoking for good 10 years ago and I was only smoking 2 a week.  I'm off of HRT too.  I knew it would hurt my health 35 years ago so that is why I waited so long.  And I hope that younger generations heed my warning on that one because wow, I was right about that.  But it could have been coffee too.  It's just dang industrial complicated out there and I may be failing the medical doctor portion of my PhD training.  I'm simply not that perfect.  Or perhaps I am perfect?  Or secret service is perfect?  Or WE ARE PERFECT.<br>
<br>
I simply don't know and may even die soon or later without knowing.  I still get up and do my job though, even if it doesn't pay and is lonely AF, becuase you don't just give up on a thing like this.  I've got way too much work invested to be in an assembly line even though I would genuinely love a basic job like that if there is no harrasement at it.<br>
<br>
OK, on with the other tasks of the day!  Good luck out there!  bye bye....<br>

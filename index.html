Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div><br>

I'm just in an odd space.<br>
<br>
I'm making, or at least practicing, national and world policy from my apartment home.  I don't have a checking account.  I may not have a savings account and if I do, I only have $5 in it.  I withdrew 19 cents out of my bank account 3 months ago which left me with 5 cents which I withdrew two weeks ago so that I would have 78 cents to buy a first class stamp to send a one sheet, two page letter to a federal prisoner who I am interested in pardoning in 2029 after only 7 years of incarceration because I believe in her innocence, at least on some level.<br>
<br>
The level that counts.</div><br></div>

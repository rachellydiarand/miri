Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

I think I've only watched late night comedy shows two or three times since 1990.  Not even kidding about that.  I've only watched CNN a couple more times than that.  I am COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH with the people who consume that kind of politics.  TV, sports, even music.  COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH.  And I will never bee catching up.<br>
<br>
That's the way things are done over here.  I live in a completely different world than the majority of people out there.  So if I say that "I hate people" or "I hate this city" or "I hate this country", it's because I really am different from the majority of people out there.  It's not simply the rice or the transgenderism.<br>
<br>
I'm not a parent.  I didn't get the fatherhood bonus.  I don't have kids to boss around.  I don't have employees to boss around.  I don't have bandmates to boss around.  That is not where my power comes from.<br>
<br>
That may be a culture shock to you.  You may not <u>want</u> me to be president because of that.  You may not think I'm qualified.<br>
<br>
BUT....  Don't come complaining to me about politics because you do not have my ear.  I think you have all been brainwashed by that stuff.<br>
<br>
I am connected with Terminator 2.  Nate and I used to ride our bicycles in those drainage canals.  I do have some respect for Jon Nelson, of course!  He was fun in the Navy.  But he was always telling gay jokes and well, of course they hit home with me and could be difficult sometimes.  My grandfather Charlie, who I got my first name after, always called me a faggot.  I've been dealing with this stuff my whole life.  Yeah, this stuff directed at me is frustrating, but of course I am used to it.  Perhaps all my Portland music friends never knew that about me.  Perhaps they are getting up to speed with me?  That it wasn't just the Navy, right?<br>

I supposed what it comes down to is... that I'd still like to do my solo show.  More than that, I'd like to be paid for my website work.  And more than that, I'd like to be a supported US Presidential candidate.<br>
<br>
Just like I said over a year ago, perhaps a nice younger partner with me.  Someone to help us move gear and handle the when and where of it all.  Get us to the stage and we'll set it up.  I'll do the show.  A mostly improvised show.  You can tell that it is me.  Actually see my humanity and not the perfection show.  And then tear down, say hi to a few people, then be escorted back to our room for a couple nights.  With my instruments and computer.  We can order food.  Do our thing.<br>
<br>
I suppose the Senate idea is a no go.  I don't want to do that legislative work anyway.  It's not like I'm going to bargain for a piece of the budget.  I'm more of a buck stops here kind of person.  Are we going to put Elliot and ET on the bicycle on the old White Stag sign now?<br>

If my politics are completely incorrect, or it's just not the time for it, then I'm simply retired.  I have no love for the way people torture me.  I'm just going to be at home doing my thing on my website.  I suppose I'm going to try to force myself to come to terms with the idea that I could be wrong.  I will not play music with or for others.  I will not detransition.  I will not work for others.  If you want to keep poisoning my food, I guess I can't stop you.<br>
<br>
In other words....  I'm OK with being a retired presidential candidate.  A retired musician and a retired software engineer.  I've had an amazing life with all that.  Of course I can't stop the work of it.  I suppose I can lower my hopes a bit for getting political support.</span><br>

It's OK.  It's not my fault.  I was probably born into some kind of Dalai Lama position and no one can tell me.  It's just not my fault and there is nothing I can do about it.</span><br>

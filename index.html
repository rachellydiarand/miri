It's likely that we have never had a zen based president like myself.  With a proper money/work situation, I just stay at home working.  Without that, I become mad as hell.<br>
<br>
I've delt with a lot of discrimination in my life.  I don't understand it.  I'm extremely critical of American culture because my culture appears to be so radically different.<br>
<br>
So, I'm sorry about all that.  I'm just a scared animal, right?  Anyone who can't get other people's money in capitalism winds up being a scared animal.  You can work and work and work, but the only way to ensure that you get other people's money is to focibly take it from them.  And that is illegal.<br>
<br>
Stealing throws off inventory.  Hey.  I'm an engineer by trade.  And I'm not a parent.  Think of it like the bridges.  I'm not going to design a bridge to fail for some kind of joke, right?  I'm completely honest and hard working.<br>
<br>
OK, OK.  I've got work to do here.  Got a little nap in.  I'm getting kinda old.  Road miles on my mind and some on my body.  I don't like being mad like this.  I'd love to have a real opportunity to perform my solo music political monolog.  It's reasonable that people need to see me with video and not just this text stuff.  It's a trust thing.<br>
<br>
I have what AA considers to be "character defects".  My approach to them is something I learned at DHX Advertisng.  There is nothing I can do about them.  I concentrate on my strengths.<br>
<br>
<b>People can band together</b>, creating unions, to do things that we CANNOT do alone.  That's all a union is.  Some things we can do alone.  Right?  Music is one of them.  With or without electronics, you can do that alone.<br>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.
<br>

<br>
Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

I've been on SSD before and got off of it and made a million dollars afterward.

I'm in need.  I really am.  And I'm working excessively hard at becoming employed, again.  I have need for a reasonable accomodation.  I really do.</div>

Good morning!  Happy Thanksgiving!</div><br>
<div class="pink"><br>
Trying to open a new chapter here this morning.  My job might be, or at least might as well be, the second coming of Jesus.  Hey, I didn't visit Jumbo Jesus in Rio, but Jane an I had a lovely steak downtown!<br>
<br>
Of course I'm back to my rice diet.<br>
<br>
Dating is a weird, weird subject for me.  It's either a lesbian relationship or a gay relationship with me.  Both of those labels don't really work either.  I'm a zen widowed transwoman housewife.  Culturally.  Raise in a strictly sober, strictly atheist, strictly no advertising household.  And even then, the masulinity in my house and neighborhood was too much for me and I simply latched onto my maternal grandmother as the only feminine role model and a way out of that masculinity.  I tried on her dresses when I stayed the night in high school and loved it.  I told myself that medical transition was likely not good for my health.  So I delayed.<br>
<br>
And now I'm a full on transwoman and I love it.  I love what I am doing.  I'm planning on running for the US Senate.  If elected, I'm going to show up in my best dress and kitten heels.  Nice new leather purse.  Politically going there to ensure food/clothing/shelter for as many people as possible.  Likely 100% of people because humanity has been busy.<br>
<br>
Meet some people.  Then start running for President right away.  Of course.<br>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.
<br>

<br>
Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

I've been on SSD before and got off of it and made a million dollars afterward.

I'm in need.  I really am.  And I'm working excessively hard at becoming employed, again.  I have need for a reasonable accomodation.  I really do.</div>

Yeah, like 80% unemployment, one gallon of gas per week per car.  Empty office space plus the current 10% of vacant housing units.  Is that spacious enough? - Ms Rand<br>

It's a dang strange situation I'm in.  People around here seem to know who I am, yet no one will actually come out and recognize or support me.  So I interpret that signal as they would support me if I change my tune.  But then that wouldn't be supporting me, now would it?<br>
<br>
I'm simply paralized from the paradox.  A deer in the headlights.  It's been this way for a whole year.  I'm trapped by it.  There is nothing to change on my end.  I know I'm right.  I know I'm good.  I know I don't have 100% of the answers.  I know what I'm asking for will work well if people will truely follow me.  I know that if people don't honestly and innocently follow me on this, then none of this will work.<br>
<br>
I keep on changing outreach methods because secret service is so good at what they do, it could be that the majority of people out there do not know about me at all and that most of the people around me and out in town are full fledged secret service.  It's a rational explaination for my lack of contributions and apparent lack of people knowing who I am or not admitting it.<br>
<br>
Back to my recent request....<br>
<br>
Bringing on 3 employees.  Finally 3 full time and even live in house employees, totally under my direction, doing work for me to lighten my load and give another interpretation of my findings.  True working together.  It would be crazy amazing!  But it must be based on full commitment to me being the 100% leader.  I know that I am an amazing leader when people are not challenging me.  I want my employees feedback.  I want them to question everything I have them working on and everything I say.  But I will not tolerate them questioning my leadership.  There is a big difference.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to be with me like that and is under 30 years old, please, please reach out.  It's really easy over here.  Just send an email.  Hopefully secret service is not rejecting these things.  Say you are on board 100% and that you are coming over right away.  You see the date above on this.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's risky.  These characters on this page could be altered on your screen.  You may show up at someone else's door because they alter just the address on that Google Doc.  Send me an email to meet in SE Portland.  I'll be there.  Come up to me when you meet me there.  You should be able to recognize me.  I'm crazy unique out there.  Make it happen.<br>
<br>
I have on my wall inside "non-believer on board".  I'm a skeptic.  I don't believe in heaven and hell after death.  I don't believe in anything after death.  I don't even believe in nothingness.  I have no concern about it at all.  I tend to naively believe people when I first meet them until they prove themselves untrustworthy to me.  So that is what that little saying is about.<br>
<br>
NO SOLICITING sign on my door is that I don't want a salesperson coming to my door.  Like 40% of the city has that on their door.  That's no big deal.  If you are coming here to be my live in employee expecting me to give you 8 hours a day of research work, you are giving to me upfront and trusting that it will come back to you.  If you are knocking on my door and there isn't a fire in the stairwell and you do not intend on moving in right now to be my employee, then you are most likely illegally soliciting here.  It's 4034 SE Holgate Blvd.  First stairway on the right, then the top right apartment.  You'll know it's my door.  Of course.  If you take the chance, there is high probability that we'll all be moving up in the world together, BIG TIME and crazy quick most likely.<br>
<br>
You see, I'm leaving all my old friends behind like this.  And I'm not joining some famous musician tribe.  I'm assembling a presidential cabinet of my own.  A mostly inexperienced team of young people who have some decent skills for these positions.  I'm training.  We're working together.  I'm hopefully that you'll be the one to stay permanently.  This is not a pre-election cabinet.  This is the real deal inner cabinet of Rachel Lydia Rand.  The formal presidential cabinet will of course have all those other official titles, but you three will be around me as my inner cabinet and all those others are doing whatever they do with the public.  Right?<br>
<br>
Hey, I'm improvising this of course, but this is how it is.  Not sure how other presidents do it.  They may do it just like this.  I don't care.  This is how I'm doing it.  This is what makes sense to me.  I'm convinced there needs to be a clean break with Generation Z.  I'm your connection to all this stuff out there.  Those other cabinet people will be taking direction from me and I'm working with you as representatives of Gen Z.  Somewhat of course.  We will be working together closely, in the same space.  In 12 years tops, we'll be out of DC and moving on from the rewiring of society.  We'll disperse into a new normal then.  And I'll be more into the retired music and staying at home LEGO thing.  Like in a wine cellar making music.  Or at my uncle's place that no one knows about.<br>
<br>
It makes sense to me.  I always get the message that I'm trying to "do it all myself".  I do a lot of different things well and my music and computer stuff is solo stuff.  But I never claimed that I could do everything.  I'm asking for help.  It's not an empty gesture.  Just because I am the commander, doesn't mean I don't want your opinion.  I'm scientific.<br>
<br>
Groups just work well with a well defined leader and I will not follow willingly.  I'm over it.  Stop feeding me, lock me away, I'm absolutely not suicidal, I'll fight back like any cornered animal, but I want to be a full being doing my work and spending time with my pack.  My old friends are gone like that.  Collie and Nora are some special representatives of Gen Z.  Comnpletely amazing people.  No need for them on the cabinet.  They are tops in my world and have my full support.  Looking for new Gen Z people.<br>
<br>
And of course serious about the personal assistant position.  I need a female fiercely looking out for my mental and physical health.  Like just by my side.  OK with watching my movies with me.  Food together.  A grounding reminder that someone is watching out for me and that I'm human.  That the torture is not ongoing.  Essentially a much younger version of Cynthia.  She was all that.  She had some loopy dementia thing.  That was just her old age her children said.  They always told me "You should have seen her back then Rand.  She was AMAZING!"  She was fiercely loyal and above all, wanted to be healthy and beautiful.<br></div>

Negotiating is on my mind this evening....<br>
<br>
I have super poor negatiating skills and my ability to initiate negoatiations is almost non-existant.  I am certainly way different than President Trump on that point.<br>
<br>
I'm just pure scientist I think.  Even with music.  I could apply my scientific curiosity to negoatiation, but negotiation seems so, well, it's just a dang weird subject for me.<br>
<br>
It's that negotiation is supposedly about making your situation, usually financial situation, better.  It's such an odd subject for me that I'm not even sure what to say about it or what my blocker is on it.  Perhaps I would do better at it politically because it wouldn't be about MY situation?<br>
<br>
It's just people weirdness to me I guess.  Perhaps it is because I have been robbed so hard and held back from being able to manage others.  People probably see me as weak, like a weak negotiator.  Yeah, that is likely it.  I'm weak in the weight lifting way and weak as a negotiator.  I don't stand up for my financial situation.  Or do I?  What can I do about it?  Is it because of guilty feelings about my fluffy acid jazz solo trombone career and then desk job freelance software programming?<br>
<br>
About not being masculine?<br>
<br>
I don't know.  This is the way I am.  You certainly wouldn't be hiring me, appointing me, as president for my raw negotating skills.  You see our President in those videos flying around the world and sitting with other leaders shaking hands and signing papers and talking about some likely negotation.  You look at me and think "She'll never be able to do that."  And you know, you'll mostly correct.<br>
<br>
Yet I seem to be connected to the top of the world order and feel that I am the poster child of "Leader of the Free World".  Do leaders negotiate?  Do you negotate with your favorite musician?  Don't fans typically write notes to their favorite musicians saying "I loved how you put that first and second song together on your third album!  It always brings up a feeling of inspiration and drives me through my workday.  Thanks for doing that!"<br>
<br>
It's not a thing of "I didn't like how you went to the four chord there.  Why didn't you think to go to the three minor and then the four minor?"  Yet that seems to be more of the norm in politics than not.<br>
<br>
Sex, politics and religion are not political correct, but music and sports fans are.  We love musicians and athletes.  Some more than others, but it's almost universal that people do not like politicians.  Some people say they support politicians, but do they really?  I've seen that most people who are supportive of a politician or even political party, are supportive because they feel their policies will put more money in their account.  The opposite is true with music fans.<br>

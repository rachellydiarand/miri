Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

This is how I see it.  It's a little bit like the Marcus Miller spoken word on Tales: "Just bogart.  Take charge."<br>
<br>
If I am elected, then I am the top elected official.  In the entire country.  If I am not elected, I'm the top person in my world because there is only one person in my world.  I'm a widowed traditional housewife.  A tradwife.  That's it.<br>
<br>
Either way, I am in the lead role.  Completely.  And finally.  Not doing this being controlled business anymore.  I have worked way, way too hard to feel like I owe people out there anything at all.  I effin' expect a normal low level existence from you all.  Throwing me out on the streets again is simply not right in any way.  If someone is working like I am, you do not throw them, and their fairly minimal gear, out in the elements.  I can't stop you, but I can scream and yell that it is an injustice.  I was cool with it mostly at 30 years old.  At 55, it is not right.<br>
<br>
Besides, I do not see many homeless people out there with sleeping bags going into the library regularly like I was.  I just don't see that anywere.  It's like 86+% of people where raised in a Christian church setting, so by far of the majority of people not only know about Christian chairty stuff, but are likely comfortable using it.  It does not make sense that all down and out looking people were raised as atheists like me.  Something does not add up here.<br>
<br>
Growing the population by a factor of 7 was not an act of war.<br>

Serious stuff about how I see my presidency if I should be so lucky as to have one....<br>
<br>
I feel that my Feminine persona is not in conflict with the masculine role of commander in chief and this is why....  The commander in chief is appointed to that position of top level authority by the people of the United States.  The president has limited control via the Constitution of the United States.  That is term limits and the checks and balances of the three tiers of government.  I don't get all contitutional on real specific things, but that part is a big, big deal.<br>
<br>
In that position, at the State of the Union ( SOTU ), I will start my speech ( like in 3 years and one month ) with "The people have put me up here before you, and you know what that means.  We are in a world wide situation of top soil depleation.  We must, fairly rapidly, reduce population to avoid massive wars in the future because of food and clothing scarcity.  You know how supply and demand works.  That would be life threatening lack of supply.  So I am suggesting to enact legislation and get the people to do this population decline civily.  I suggest telling people to stop construction immediately.  These cities are our legacy.  Our pyramids.  Our homes.  We want half built skyscrapers and other buildings as the final peice.  Just like the half built Death Stars in episodes III and VI."<br>
<br>
After that, I'll assemble my cabinet.  ( this is where my feminine role comes in mixed with my authority )  I will not be engaging my cabinet on policy.  I will be taking inventory through them of what each federal organization has and is capable of.  Just as I've been saying, I will then form a private cabinet composed ENTIRELY OF GEN Z PEOPLE.  They will be inheriting this future world and I want them making decisions.  It's radically different and I will guide them on the options.  We'll work it out, ask more questions of the "other" cabinet, then form a plan which I will TELL the "other" cabinet to implement.<br>
<br>
So that way, I can be as feminine as possible.  I'm not some part of a team like that.  If I am up there, I am in charge of those branches, highly linked to our money supply, and will be running that whole effort.  Then I can just do my normal, stay at home ( in the white house ) daily routine with my software thing, building utility apps for the internal management of the software team that will handle how the new money supply works with the new distribution of food/clothing/shelter, on the federal level which includes Fanny and Freddie Mac and the freeway system.  And of course the international community including but not limited to "the world's factory".  right?<br>
<br>
It's not like I am going to be making consumer facing, secure, websites.<br>
<br>
I'm of course way cool with Ann ( she wears the pants in the family, I (RAND) just iron them ) taking control of the music part of the "community" in the east wing as I will be spending most of my time at home and in the west wing ( not sure what it is really like, I'll see when and if I get there, I'll bring my accelerometer device ).  And I'll likely have the RUSH NERDS close by in the WEST if I can ever get through to them that I don't want to ALWAYS play the songs just like the record.<br>
<br>
I'm feeling better overall.  Not sure about this health situation I have.  I've realized that I do not "go out with men to be one of the guys".  I treat them as dates.  Have been for several years now and it's actually a long time thing with me.  No wonder I recoil when asked to go out to beers or strip clubs.  I can only assume that men go with men to those places not because they are in love with each other.  I'm just way too romantic to go out with anyone unless it is like the Italian Restaurant scenario.  Like "Business is good and the family is fine.  Been a while.  How are you?  Have you tried the olives?"<br>
<br>
That said, I do, of course, like to play a spacy bass line and look like a weird ( because I am a weird ) in teh corner, over and over and over and over.  Just like at the NATO building at 7am, right?  Anyone, anyone who was there knows that.  duh!~<br>

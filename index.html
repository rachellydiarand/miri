Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Just trying to keep it informative and funny at the same time.  Sorry about being so drawn out.  This is my little workshop.  You likely get the reader's digest version on some other platform....<br>

I constantly hear people complaining to me in person that they "Do not like the rich.  They want transparency in the money in politics.  The politicians are in it to get rich.  They don't care about people."  Yet I am in the race, multiple times, with no money at all sometimes yet am able to be a financially qualified candidate 3x with one time being #8 of 14 democratic presidential candidates.  I am in extreme poverty so bad my heath is terrible.  And yet, no support at all.<br>
<br>
How can I interpret that logic?<br>
<br>
1. They think I am in it for the money and fame.<br>
<br>
2. They just want to bring down Trump.<br>
<br>
3. They enjoy complaining about Trump.<br>
<br>
4. There is no one better than Trump or their team didn't <i>win</i> so it's a shame.<br>
<br>
5. They are simply passing time until the super bowl.<br>
<br>
6. They are protestants and that is just their little work party talk.<br>
<br>
<br>
In any case.  I feel that my politics are mostly correct.  As is my gender orientation and sexuality.  I may just be a canary in the coal mine, a guinea pig in a cage, who has been given a lethal dose and society is simply examinining the way I die, similar to Heraldo in the Made for TV version of <i>The Stand</i> with Gary Sinese and Molly Ringwald.  Except I'm in Portland Oregon and not in Portland Maine waiting for the REM show.</span><br></div>

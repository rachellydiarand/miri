Good morning!<br>
<br>
Wow, dark sexual fantasies now and real hope that they may come true.  And perhaps even more.  I don't know where this is going.  Eric told me a couple years ago "It's not what you think it is."  Well, wow, not sure what it is or what is possible.<br>
<br>
Although I have never considered myself suicidal, I've been pressed so hard and that combined with the logic of population decline and that I never had children.  And now no family or tangible friends.<br>
<br>
I'm watching this video of a young woman who is mostly flat chested and completely tied up with ropes.  With a whole room of people watching.  This thing is saying there are just two videos made of her essentially and the other one has her completely restrained as well.  It just feels like she has some sense of what I have been through.<br>
<br>
She may even be a fan of mine.<br>
<br>
Will I die?  Will we get together?  Will she die?  Is there a whole generation of raver people to die with us?  Will they transport us to exotic locations?<br>
<br>
The secret service has me.  The world has all of us like that.  We didn't choose to be born in this time.  People have different beliefs.  Different lives.<br></div>

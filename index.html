Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

My research is showing that all this culture we live in came from a 1946 post WWII proclamation called the EMPLOYMENT ACT: "Maximum employment, maximum productivity, maximum purchasing power"<br>
<br>
Worldwide<br>
<br>
Why though? If you were 22 years old in 1946, you were born in 1922 and would be 104 today. Those people, and people older than them created this baby boom on the heels of fresh memories of WWII and the Great Depression. This directive went straight to the US Fed monetary supply controls.<br>
<br>
The dams were built and the freeways were built. (This is kind of my Terminator 2 thing when Sarah Connor shot Miles Dyson and then the Terminator told them the whole history. At least in my little ego centric existence....)<br>
<br>
It's like Charles Logan, the President in 24 Season 5. Or Vaclov Smil. Nothing gets done without energy. Stuff just fell on the ground in one place until we started moving it around. Now like a huge number of us are flying all over the planet accumulating frequent flyer miles. Hey, how many boomer rock stars played music on 4 continents before they were 29yo like I did?<br>
<br>
Why? Likely it was just a one time shot. We won't be able to replace all the shielding on the house wires. So we grew population, then held it steady as we could by frustrating people economically in an effort to have less children all while we are drowning in manufactured products. How can we possibly be so productive?<br>
<br>
And it's highly unlikely we'll be able to fix all this, to get us to where we need to be, by continuing the rat race to right size population for the next future of humanity. It's highly likely that this energy and top soil situation will be coming to an end in the next 50 years, just like the UN has been suggesting. When it does, everything we built will be both humanity's legacy, like the pyramids, and a gigantic scavenger's parts store.<br>
<br>
I predict there will be a stop construction date and there will be half built skyscrapers like the Death Star in episodes III and VI. "They" may even shut down the world's factory, ship out all the clothing machines worldwide and just ship replacement parts from then on. It's not like we haven't gotten it down yet. All we need is another bored meeting to figure out how to pick cucumbers....<br>

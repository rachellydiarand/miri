Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

I'd say that it is highly likely that the majority of the people in this city absolutely know who I am and are simply lying and torturing me every day.  And part of the torture is to try to get me to love them for it.<br>

I asked somewhere on Transgender Pulse, or perhaps in a direct messaage there, I asked Kathy Lauren if I could see the results of her sugery in person because I am interested in getting it.  She responded with that my request was out of line and rude.  Well....<br>
<br>
I'm quite certain she is the one who is out of line and is a Christian lying stupid person.  I believe that her attitude about this is the exact opposite of what is needed to have a surgery like that.  If you had that kind of surgery, you would definitely want people touching you in person.<br>

I think a lot of people in our society are just Christian warior murderers.  I believe that as industrialism falls apart, the bible will be one of the least intresting books out there (it already is).  They are kind of like calculus books.  From what I can tell, it's mostly non-sense math.  Can you really think about an equation with a range in it?  It seems that the concept is so difficult, there should be like two chapters in the beginning of every calculus book describing that IN DETAIL.  But no, they just press on with a lot of non-sense.  They don't even tell you about how the trigonometric function works.<br>
<br>
They likely reveal this to engineers sometime in college and then give them an assignment to harass and discriminate against homeless people to build character and uphold societal norms so they can get the underdog to build silly elevators in churches that Rachel was shamed for being the only dissenting vote on.  I'm sure there is some rational explanation.  It's just another elevator in a small church.  Like $400,000.  I suppose I haven't even inspected the final product on my own.  And now I've had $40 total in 6 months, scrounging around town for dental floss at orginzations like those?  Well, the dental floss is probably poisoned.  That's the real world folks.  Chrisitian people, christian parents are out of touch with our modern world.<br>
<br>
Q: Will we continue to band together in unions and churches when society breaks down over the next 100 years? That's a pretty heavy question for both the insiders and outsiders of our church communities.<br>

Good evening!<br>
<br>
Well, my life may be ending soon.  I'm kind of assessing my physical situation.  I'm like completely bloated.  It's likely my blood will start getting dirty and there will be no way to clean it.  I won't be able to consume water.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I avoided strip clubs and sex scenes.  Those are not my places.  Churches too.  The AA meetings were fun for a bit, until they rejected me.  I don't know what all that was about.<br>
<br>
Like the song goes, no regrets.  Just a life well lived.  I've had an amazing time and really just want nylon stockings, shaving gel and razors now.  Home is fairly comfortable.  The computer is AMAZING!  Love this thing.  Bass is amazing too!  Keyboard is acceptable.<br>

Ayn Rand's short novel <i>Anthem</i> can be triggering when reading the first chapter.  Getting past that is key.  It's an excellent book.
<br>

<br>
I enjoy thinking about our future.  People are being cruel to me personally.  I'm kind of a prisoner like that.
<br>

Whatever this is, it is cruel to me.  People either flat out hate me and treat me this way or they are doing it for some alturistic purpose.  It's cruel that I have to haul my laundry all over town.  If there is some logical reason for it, it's cruel not to tell me.
<br>

<br>
So it's just cruel.  That's how I interpret how I'm being treated.

I'm just being tortured by the thought "What do you want?"  Well, I want donations.  Contributions.  For my EXTENSIVE POLITICAL WORK.  So I can purchase NORMAL things.  Like a sponge for the kitchen and to be able to turn on the washing machine and dryer.  I'm a transwoman, so there are a few abnormal things if you think that shaving gel and razors are all that abnormal.
<br>

<br>
Listening to RUSH's Vital Signs this morning.  It's wonderful!
<br>

<br>
I want to code some software and make some music, duh!  But I have all this other financial stuff stopping me from having enough peace to be able to do it.  So I run around town.  Doing errands on the bus which is a huge time killer.  But I perform my political monolog on the bus and that's pretty neat.  People seem to be mostly impressed and attentive.  I have no idea why they don't contribute.  I've contributed to presidential candidates who did not win before.  Several times.  And I'm certainly in need.  Look around, there are a few others too.  People are just too chicken to give them a few dollars for fear that they will buy some drug or something like a smoke.  Just consider that you may be incorrect and they may be in the market for a kitchen sponge.
<br>

<br>
Here is the house I sold and one that I saw on my screen yesterday.  I obviously have no bargaining power in the men's world.

After reading Geddy Lee's book several times, I then started picking up on the idea here too, from this very first sentance (in the Prologue), that I too was named after a relative murdered in a war like activity.  The Korean war.  It might not have been as obvious as this, but uncle Rand being cast into the Puget Sound or ocean by the boom arm of the family sailboat and then my maternal grandfather diving in to save him and both dying.  The resulting trauma on my mother, aunt and grandmother.  My taking after my grandmother as my by far top role model in the family because of her elegant, clean nature.  My transgenderism is based on this.  I work slacks to high school.  The boomers and the slackers.
<br>

<br>
"Industrialism had an expiration date stamped on it at the factory." - Ms Rand
<br>

<br>
Not even kidding about this.  I'd say it is highly likely that Geddy Lee's and my life have been highly orchestrated to bring this message to you and around the world.
<br>

<br>
I kind of feel like Sting is the world leader in all this and Geddy Lee and I are the North American Continent authorities.  Believe me, I've got some odd and interesting stories!

<br>
Let me try to do this posting again.  I'm struggling for the right words and message here.
<br>

<br>
1. A presidential agrument.  Stating a case.
<br>

<br>

<br>
In order to be successful, I need:
<br>

<br>
1. Supporters.
<br>
2. A good home life.
<br>
3. To remain transgender.
<br>

<br>
My ideal partner is just what I say she is.  Young and innocent.  I don't want some big intellectual discussion when I get home from talking with world leaders.  Someone who can accept me as transgender.  I have some serious road miles on me, especially on my mind.  Someone to love me the way I am.</div>
<br>

<br>

<br>
It just seems like people would want to be with me.  That some young girl would love to come home with me and I'd show her the music and software I do.  The presidential work.  The computer work.  Cook a meal.  Watch a movie.
<br>

<br>
I don't go out.  I don't go out to concerts.  I don't go out to sports.  I don't go out to clubs.  Going out to a dinner and movie just seems so odd to me.  I understand the dinner, part.  I love food.  And that brings up the other problem that I have had like $40 in the last over 6 months.  Like total.  I'm in extreme poverty, but I've made $270,000 in the last 3 years.  Most of it was at athenahealth.  Working with Ben Coate.  You could probably even call them up and ask for Ben and ask about me.  He absolutely knows me extremely well.  He's friggin amazing.
<br>

<br>
I'm simply exotic.  I have pictures of two girls I am interested in, but they are not in my environment.  For all I know, those pictures are a hundred years old.  I saw a girl on the bus today who excited me.

I'm looking forward to this little event today!  Who knows what this city will do, right?  It could just be the two of us.  Or a crowd.  Or just me rejected.  Again.  I'm pretty used to it.<br>
<br>
They say that my housing here is solid now.  VA-HUD will keep it going indefinately.  They opened me up to going other places for medical too.  Christmas together?  Quilts?  Something?  I'm sure they will guild us and the situation together.  That's what they do, right?  I mean, if you are seriously considering coming out today, you've likely been vetted by the secret service and don't even know about it.  That's why they call it the secret service.  It's something to get used to in my little world.<br>
<br>
It's highly likely that I will be one of a rapidly decreasing amount of people who will have access to air travel in the future.  So, not so ashamed of using that FOMO with you.  It could be cool, right?  The best of the best in many ways.<br>

It's a lot of variables to hold in your head at one time....<br>
<br>
Don't fall into the idea that since we have plenty of oil on Earth, that we'll be able to continue driving cars.  If we are burning gas, we are creating asphalt oil, solid booster rocket oil jet fuel, gas and propane/natural gas.  And plastics.<br>
<br>
We'd have to dispose of a lot of it.  Would we put it back in the used oil well?  Well, still, without rubber, it's a no go all around, right?  That's probably why they gave me a rubber seed in South America.  <br>
<br>
<br></div>

<div class='post'>
<h4>2025-12-12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23:16:36 PM</h4>
It's like, it feels like the majority of people in my environment when I'm out around town, if they are interacting with me, are simply making fun of my relationship status.  They don't seem to want to join me, work with me, and I don't understand that.<br>
<br>
Anyway.<br>
<br>
It seems that the people I work with, you know, the secret service and military people, are going to keep my little scene going here and are saying I should not worry about it.  So there is that.<br>
<br>
It's obviously highly political.  Getting into the more gritty details of it, we'll be losing a lot right from the git go.  And that should be a strong reminder that we HAVE TO DECREASE POPULATION.  As I understand it, it's not a battle.  Not a war.  If we don't decrease population, we either all die by killing eachother or we all starve to death.  There is no escape from ALL OF HUMANITY DYING.  There will likely be very few of us left at the end of the century.<br>
<br>
Is that too extreme?  What is our energy source going to be?  What food are we going to eat?  How will it get to us?  We can keep the gasoline going, but we may not have tires.<br>
<br>
<span class="highlight"><b>Remember: Our world population was at 1 billion before this baby boom stuff.  We apparently increased x8.  Without tire rubber, we'll be back at that 1 billion pretty quickly.  And we even had tire rubber then.<br>
<br>
Wires use rubber.  That's the K-PAX movie.  With Kevin Spacey.  He was involved in some sex scandal and that made people distance themselves from him, but K-PAX is excellent.<br>

The idea about this future world is, that we, the human race, will become like our zoo animals.  The big creatures on the planet.  Not enough food down here to support us anymore.  The difference being that we will be our own zookeepers.  Us and our machines I guess, but our machines don't care about us.  They need us to survive.  That isn't the way it is with our zoo animals.  Our zoo animals are our pets of a kind.  <br>
<br>

Look, I'm going to attempt to put this issue of my partner selection to rest, once and for all....
<br>

<br>
Because of the high probability that air travel in the future is going to be massively limited, I think would be irresponsible of me to have an older partner.  Even if I did desire that, which I obviously do not.

I understand the discipline of the military.  Uniformity on the production line.  Traditional routines that simply work producing enjoyable products.  Useful and enjoyable tools.
<br>

<br>
I say that since we do all this big time building stuff, we may as well have some fancy fighter planes to be able to destroy things if we need to.  I don't see it as an ethnic cleaning thing beyond of course we want the future generations to have the best of the best.
<br>

<br>
I think the main purpose of the military is to be able to bomb our structures if they get to be a problem and we don't have any better way of dealing with it.  If a structure is going to become a bug home and spread to the whole city and we don't have enough humans to tear it apart brick by brick or even with a wrecking ball, then yeah, what a cool job, right?  The bugs will take over anyway, we're just kicking the can down the road a few millimeters in the big scope of things!

One thing about me, is that I am not Christian based.  I'm just not.  I have some understanding.  I have some respect.  But I was raised atheist and adopted a solitary zen practice.  Zen monk, monk, theolonius monk.  Thelonious and Nellie.  Well, they were a little extreme of course.
<br>

<br>
Renee brought up her group before Halloween a few years ago "The Scarolers".  Well, I practiced a couple times for that, but I'm just not a halloween person at all.  Now, it's like every day for years has been "the scarolers".  It's funny, and exhausting.
<br>

<br>
I'm transgender.  A relationship with a female with me is somewhat lesbian, 'cause you know I'll be slinking around the living room in my nylons if I am rich enough.
<br>

<br>
And dating musicians, because I was a professional musician as one of my two paid careers, is a little different it seems.  The lack of money, exotic lifestyle, very public life and being an attraction is much different than dating someone in the trades.
<br>

<br>
Especially the bit about being an attraction.  I'm such a high level attraction, asking someone out is pure torture.  It really is.  And I've managed to do it a few times.  IRL.  All of them were rejections I believe.  Except for Ann, well Marge too.  You know, they played trombone right next to me :-)
<br>

<br>
Athletes are a little different than musicians, but it's kind of the same thing.  Do some research.

It's all become too virtual for me.  I think....
<br>

<br>
I have desire to have help.  I don't know what I'm doing on some levels.  I'm having fun.  I'm learning.
<br>

<br>
If they sent me to Mars, I'd be the biggest attraction in the world, right?  A true world representative.  Do they send 4 to Mars?  Well, I'd say the possibility of it, physically, is below 50%.
<br>

<br>
It's a stress point for me.  It's fun and torturous.  It's part of my job as I understand it.  Things are very odd around here.  The word "lonely" doesn't quite describe the feeling.  I don't feel lonely, but I am most certainly alone.
<br>

<h4>2025-12-10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20:01:18 PM</h4>
So, there is a getting to know you thing here.  Fans, everyone.  People near and far.  I'm just really nervous around social media.  Apps.  I lived in a media vacuum.  I said that over and over on my website.
<br>

<br>
I believe it is a source of power, not weakness.  We live in a media saturated environment.  Our brains only have so much capacity.
<br>

<br>
Good enough?  Well, you tell me, I guess.  I go to work each day.  My careers, all three are intellectual, so really just waking up is going to work.
<br>

<br>
Extremely unpaid, torturous work.
<br>

<br>
I grew up in a rich enough household to not care much about money.  In the 1980's, my dad was giving me like a $30/week allowance?  Maybe $40?  Something like that.  He took us to Reno, the MGM Grand, like once a year.  I don't believe I have ever placed a bet in a casino.  But I love classic arcade games!  More than pinball.  It's the angles and creativity.  Not the rat race timing of it.  I'm not so into deadlines.  I'm kinda engineer like that too.  It's got to be right.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Do you trust me to get the project done?  Do you help me?  I can't do it all alone, right?  If I was on a ship, alone, to Mars, I would know that I had the help of humanity, right?  Not simply abandoned on the street corner.  That "they" wanted me up there with my music collection.  My skills.  That people knew me, how I thought.  So when they ask "What does it feel like?"  I can respond and well, that's about as best as we can get, right?
<br>

<br>
But there is the "grow up or grow out" concept.  That without the rotational gravity of the Earth, you would radiate like a star.  And roll like a snowball?

Good evening?  How was your sleep?
<br>

<br>
It turns out that my [ m o t h ] Picture Viewer app is releasing memory properly.  I had seen a memory spike a few months ago and was concerned that there was a memory leak.  So then I coded a slideshow feature into it the other day and was concerned it would gobble up all the memory and crash the app, or worse, burn up my computer!
<br>

<br>
So I opened up the Ms Task Manager and watched the memory profiler.  The RAM usage during the slideshow will go up to 600MB, but then it does garbage collect it and goes down to like 30MB.  So, that is good to know!
<br>

<div class="pink">
<br>
People like to talk politics about all kinds of social things.  I get it.  People put a lot of work into all these structures and utilities around here.
<br>

<br>
If we are going to ratchet down industrialism in a non "triangular wave" pattern, like liberty bell curve pattern, then that likely means:
<br>

<br>
1. Decreasing oil refining.  This has to be a linear fashion.  There would be less of every product of the distilation column.
<br>

<br>
2. Likely ending residential natural gas.  I know, this is a bummer.
<br>

<br>
3. Less asphalt.  We may be able to get it straight from "tar sands" in Canada.  I've seen reports about that.  It sounds like they are soaking them in water to extract oil from them currently.  There are some other indicators in my environment about this.
<br>

<br>
4. Abandoning paving some roads.
<br>

<br>
5. Ceasing most new housing construction.
<br>

<br>
6. Limited hardware supplies for remodeling.
<br>

<br>
7. Continued food and clothing of course.  The limiting factor to all of this is that we have to keep diesel gas going for commercial traffic.  And we need gas for people to get to the store and essential workers.
<br>

<br>
8. Limited air travel most likely.
<br>

<br>
9. Online ordering of any new products from the "industrial machine".  Local pickup may be a thing, but it certainly won't be the "browsing the isles" that we have seen for all of eternity.  You'll likely need some kind of online authorization.  Electric Amazon trucks aren't massively dependent on the distilation column, right?
<br>

<br>

<br>
As you can see, if this is happening, this is a MAJOR world change.  Population decline goes along with this.  We essentially took all the good oil, bananas, rubber and other exotic products from those highly productive areas of the planet and moved them around.  This depleated top soil in all those regions which reduces output of any new products.  We have this problem everywhere.
<br>

<br>
Population decline is key and my transgenderism isn't really a WAY TO DECREASE POPULATION.  Ya know?  It's just my style of living folks.  Yeah, I do this loopy music thing.  But I do politics for a living.  I haven't made money at it yet, but it's likely going to happen here soon.  I sure hope it is, cause wow, I have put a lot of work into this and if you only knew all the signals I am getting from my life of training.  It is blinding weirdness these stories of my life.
<br>

<br>
Fun stuff too though!  It looks like Sting is having some fun!  Hey, I'm a different person, right?  Go a little easy on me.  I am a torture victim.
<br>

<br>
OK, scones came out of the oven!  Thank you John Kanell!
<br>

<br>
10. Shoe rubber.  Whether is is latex or a distalation column product, this stuff was good for running and better than those leather shoes.  Perhaps the marijuana thing is for those groovy hemp wedge sandal heels?  And welcome mats?  It's also good for incense.

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.

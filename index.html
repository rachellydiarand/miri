I'm employing thr RUSH lyric: "One must put up barriers to keep onself intact."
<br>

<br>
I am not knocking on doors.  Not here, not anywhere.  It's solicitation and I've done enough of that unsuccessful crap for this lifetime.  That's me, not you.  I have a no soliciting sign on my door.  If you are knocking on my door to join my team as a fan and not expecting or rather demanding pay, then that isn't really soliciting, I guess.
<br>

<br>
I am asking for loyal employees under the age of 30.  This isn't some super professional thing over here.  If you are working at any level close to what I was at 25 years old, you're golden with me.
<br>

<br>
You see, I've had a boss essentially who is 15 years younger than me getting me most of my work for the last 15-20 years.  He's amazing.  Wonderful person, but he also was terrible about paying me on time and he would be pretty agressive with me as a boss sometimes.
<br>

<br>
I'm the fucking big boss now.  I'm not taking orders from people.  Secret service is secret service, the world order like that, but one day, hopefully fairly soon, they will reveal themselves and then they'll be the person visually at the door or in the living room.  That'll be a welcome change.
<br>

<br>
Again, loyal employees.  I was locked up in jail for a week charged with 5 assault felonies.  I'm of course completely innocent at my core and have a rational reason for everything including essentially having two saftey(s) on them.  I was sexually harrassed at a bank right before my little tirrade too.  The court appointed attorney sure got an earful from me.  I told her I'd be representing myself and calling the most famous musicians in the world up for expert testimony to get to the bottom of whether I am delusional or absolutely on point with my political theories.  I was totally at peace with waiting in solitary for my day in court to either walk out as a full world leader or spend up to 6 years in prison.  At least I would have a definitive answer and I'd get my basic meals brought to me and could continue to work all day long without running BS errands all over town.
<br>

<br>
The court appointed lawyer probably wasn't expecting me to respond to her "But you could be in prison for 70 months" with "Yeah, I've been through something similar before, I'll take my chances again.  My politics are more important than that."
<br>

<br>
The state dropped the case and I just walked out and went back home to an apartment with the electric cut off.  Electric is back now.  I'm dealing with the food situation again.  The food thing is still torture, but I'm doing my best with it.  Better than jail food.  At least the jail was warm.  The blue mattress pad there was kinda new too, so it was better than the rock surface.
<br>

<br>
Reviewing my previous charges was laughable.
<br>

<br>
On the AA front, I'm pretty mad at them.  They abused me when I came to them for help in 2004 and then again in 2005.  Then I went back to them in 2022 to see if I can make some decent friends.  I was close to success there, but they rejected me yet again.  And now I'm just being stupid and feeling guilty like it is my fault.
<br>

<br>
I get the feeling that they think my HRT use was simple drug use.  That couldn't be farther from the truth.  My feeling is that the majority of the people in those rooms enjoy that junky vibe of taking hit after hit.  That's not the way I use drugs.  I take a couple hits of pot then play music for hours.  My brother did it the same way with his carpentry work.  You go in those AA rooms and here a lot of talk about staying sober and some comedy tragic stuff, but you rarely hear about people's work lives whether they were high or not.  I tend to sit on the sidelines braiding and looking pretty.
<br>

<br>
I had 3 people from the meetings come to my home for some food experiences and that was actually worth all the hassle with it.  It sucks that lasting friendships were not formed from that.
<br>

<br>
Is anyone ever going to reach out to me?  Like in applying for one of my JOB OPENINGS?  I obviously want to work with people.  I have set the parameters.  Live on site position like it is the white house and you are on the cabinet of the commander in chief.  3 positions.  It's OK if you are solo and just want one of the positions.  The HR position person is designed to "grow" a campaign staff, but I do not care about that side of it all that much.  I don't care how big it gets.  I don't want to interact with that side of the business much.  I'm in it for the politics.  I've got research to lead and the HR/Campaign side is there for media exposure to bring in money and votes.  I'm not in politics to get votes.  I'm in it for the issues and driving business philosophy.  I'm in it to lead a political party, NOT JOIN ONE.  I'm a registered Republican now because I MAY align more with their platform more than the Dems.
<br>

<br>
I think that metro area democracy will be a continuing thing, but interstate commerce will be communistic or rather militaristic.  I'm kind of aligning on the Dwight Eisenhauer side of the business there.  It's the Come Together song idea.  I know it may not seem like that song works that way on the surface, but I'm pulling that meaning into play here.  It's on Marcus Miller's M2 as well.  I don't enjoy the song anymore and it was never a huge favorite, but I'm obviously closely connected to Timothy Leary.  It is about transportation and production.  We'll have tight control over raw material distribution between metro areas.  Gasoline, wood, metal, plastic and anything produced with those materials bound for any other metro area.  You get the idea.
<br>

<br>
I realized that residential natural gas is likely on it's way out soon.  Water is likely not a huge problem and neither is elecricity mostly.  Wires may be harder to come by than dams.  Again, it's all the more reason to make a significant decline in population in a civil manner.  And have this young generation make a clean break from the older people.  So that is certainly part of my not wanting to have people over 30 years old on my staff.
<br>

<br>
That's were I'm at this evening.  You know, if we have some dire water shortage, we're all toast anyway.  They may be wanting to use wastewater sewage as crop fertilizer and that may be a reason to stop shaving cream usage.  I'm a transwoman and shaving with shaving cream is crazy important to me.  I was wearing nylons and minidresses all day long years before starting HRT and was crazy sober for years and years before all that.  It's not a drug thing with me and I DO NOT APPRECIATE people, especially AA/NA people giving me bad vibes for using HRT thinking that I'm a simple drug addict.  I'm a torture and rape victim.  Long time torture and rape victim and long time transgender.  This goes back to my childhood.
<br>

<br>
It's upsetting to me that so much of AA and society is about "man up".  Call me gay, it's OK.  I get wonderful ideas of having my little team here and getting silly playing music and playing around with work activities.  I enjoy my zen playfulness.  Bringing male sexuality into the fold with a "man up" attitude destroys that culture.  Zen is more of a child beginners mind attitude.  It's not childish at all.  It's not druggy at all, but having some experience with drugs does help to cultivate the mentality.  It helps to see things from another point of view.

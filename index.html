Look, more age difference relationship stuff from me (unfortunately, I'm getting tired of sharing this stuff, but it is important).
<br>

<br>

<br>
I was shamed in the rave scene of 2000/2001 for wanting to form a relationship with my step daughter's (dad's new wife's daughter, I'm not good at knowing what these people are called) "third" friend (not her best friend).  She was young.  Yes.  Likely 17 just like them.  I was 29.  That's 12 years difference.
<br>

<br>
Today, I'm 54 and she is 42.
<br>

<br>
And because I am so dang rock star, in almost every way conceivable, I'm simply in the market for someone like that, yet again.  This happens over and over with me.  And I have a long, long list of justifications.  Sure, 17 is too young and I understand the "still living at home with the folks" age gap problem, no matter how outside the line you are.
<br>

<br>
My thing is of kind of being a perpetual child.  It's true and not true.  I'm simply zen about life.  Childless.  Not a parent.  Parents seem to have some other reality going on that they learn from teaching their children.  Telling them to do this and that from the daily chore of teaching them.  They may "think" they understand what it is like to be childfree, but I insist that they do not in fact.  They may "remember" what it was like at their likely much younger age than me, but they certainly do not know what it is like to be a single, crazy advanced rock star president, childless transwoman at age 55.  They can observe me like a guinea pig and imagine, but they are doing something radically different by raising children.  Something I don't understand.
<br>

<br>
I am learning some of their child raising techniques from observation in my advanced politics.  Again, I see the patterns in my life and you could label it "gay" and I'm coming to some kind of peace about being labeled with that.
<br>

<br>
Sting is a father and a hugely successful, filthy rich, musician.  We are both amazing musicians, no doubt about that.  But we are very different in some basic ways.
<br>

<br>
And I'm in this role of, like even "anti-moral" role of the death after birth bill and other tactics to encourage people to civilally reduce population rather quickly.  And that means, simply, DO NOT HAVE 6 CHILDREN LIKE STING SAYS THAT HE DID.  He is a boomer generation.  His parents where the generation that created the boom.
<br>

<br>
My generation, from my little perspective, had a lot of essentially drug poisoning and mental health crisis, massive rat race economics, to get people to have less children.  And it was marginally successful and will not come close to what I am suggesting we need to do.
<br>

<br>
So that is why, both personally and professionally.  Then again, age doesn't matter all that much to me and I have no idea where this will wind up other than I have these skills that are like a static charge wanting to become lightning or a controlled DC flow to the AC/DC converters at the power transfer stations.

Q: How quickly do we need to reduce population?<br>
<br>
Think of it like this....  If industrialism goes into low gear like I am expecting and population stays stead state, what is going to happen when a bunch of stuff starts breaking down?  If population is declining fast, they'll be able to pick up some replacement parts fairly quickly without a lot of hassle.  If population is steady state, there will be high demand for those "spare parts".  With 80% unemployment, that'll create a violence scene that'll just keep escalating through time.<br>
<br>
And it's highly likely that we have a major top soil problem to contend with as well.  So add food and water shortages to that "spare parts" problem, and you can see where all that would wind up.<br>
<br>
<br>
In my little world, it's that serious.  Look, I'm turning 55 in a month and a half.  Working on my little encore career.  Society just set me up with rent and utilities.  I managed to assemble a couple lists of items I am in huge need of, like bath towels and kitchen sponges, and I'm having some success with that.  I actually don't care about the raw money all that much.  I don't like people leaving crap for me on the streets themselves.  I interpret that as Christian hate because of my upbringing.  Same thing with going to Chritian organizations for handouts.  I understand the coupon clipping aspect of it and the need for it.  I do not understand the "rehabilitation" end of it.  For someone like me, it would be better them just telling the truth: "This is what we have.  It's lower end stuff of course, but some of it is still good.  Just take it."  I don't want to sign up for your little "program".  Some people may need that and/or benefit from that, but I'm obviously working my little heart and brains out here.<br>
<br>
If people want me around, if you want to be my friend, you'll contribute to my political organization.  I'm the leader of some underground team <u>and you know who they are</u>.  Forget your political party affiliation.  It's OK to keep ignoring me.  It's your choice.  I'll just sit here and continue my thing without support until I die.<br>
<br>
I'm kind of a slave.  It's easy to control someone when there is a huge team effort and I only have $1.50.  It's hard to play the piano when a cat is biting your hand.</span><br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Remember: <u>music is a side-show with me</u><br>
<br>
And it's not going to be a thing of I have to do music to be elected.  In fact, I do not even care about doing it that way at all.  I need your vote of confidence now.  Without me doing much more campaigning.  I obviously have done everything I can on those levels.  I am ready to do the commander in chief job now.  Always learning though.  I've got the big picture and my role  in it all solved though.  The computer money thing.  How to deal with the cabinet.  If anyone is trying to run me, they get fired.  Simple as that.<br>

<span class="pink">If our gender norms insist that women are the ones who need to be picked, then it makes sense this Female on my ID, right?  Just another indication that I am counter culture.  Counter gender.</sapn><br>

I know what I want obviously.  I got the secret service message a few weeks ago: "Welcome to the billionaire's club."  Yeah, that is what it feels like.  If this works, it will be the ultimate rags to riches story.  Then again, I like a military edge to things, so that makes sense too.  I don't know how to break through this relationship barrier.  It makes sense that no one would want to take a big risk with me.  What will happen when I'm a sure thing?  I guess there is the not having children and threat of assassination to contend with.</span><br>

I don't care what political party pursuation or religion you are a part of.  Newborns are just about worthless.  Sure, the fact that they survived birth is something, but now they are on this road of needing 20 years of eduction, food, clothing, shelter.  They will not be contributing anything significant to society for a long, long time.  And even then, they may be unlucky and die at 20 years old and it will all be for nothing as far as society goes.<br>
<br>
For me and my health problems, if I do indeed have any major health problems, I have lived my life.  Almost everything I have gone after has been accomplished.  I never went after riches.  My software career happened.  My political campaigns, including the presidential campaign(s) happened.  My music happened.  I was never in it for gigs.<br>
<br>
Even on the relationship end, I mostly got what I was after.  Cynthia and Patty where that good.  I'm simply trying to replicate those relationships and homelife.  And it doesn't even matter because I am old like that.  It would be nice though!</span><br>
<br>
<span class="babyBlue"><br>
And my transfemininity happened too.  In a major way!</span><br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

<h4>2025-12-14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;06:50:50 AM</h4>
My medical condition may be fatal soon.  I've got some internal leaking it appears.  I mostly feel fine.  I could last a month or twenty years.<br>
<br>
I'm sick of dealing with people, that much is certain.<br>
<br>
If I have any final wishes, well, it's pretty well known already.  Doing my work with a lovely young woman by my side.  Maybe gangbang sex if I'm on my way out truly.  I mostly want to code software and play music at home.  An allowance for some nice clothing.  I don't know what's possible, but I have my computer scene in the bedroom now and I love how it is.  It could be better as far as ergonomics go.  Not a show stopper.<br>
<br>
It's the stress of having to go around town constantly to get supplies, deal with agencies to keep my housing.  Doing stuff for the political campaign.<br>
<br>
I feel like my message has been distributed, but I don't have much proof.  I have people around me treating me poorly and that is frustrating.  It could be they are doing that so that I will give up on going out so that I may make some music and software?  I simply don't understand signals from other people.<br>
<br>
I'm doing the best I can.<br>

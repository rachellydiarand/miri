I remember now.  His name is Al Grey.  The Count Basie band trombonist who did the fancy plunger work.  I remember playing Tall Cotton with the Youthsound Jazz Big Band.  I don't quite remember the melody off hand, but it may come back to me.</span><br>

Things are moving along and this evening is making me feel a little more at ease.  The difference between paranoia and limelight.  I know I'm good with the bits and the bytes.  The dots on the page and the sensation of the air waves.  Been around to do some surveying on Earth.  Many people have.<br>

It is nice to hear a wide array of questions this evening.  Becuase it is evening on the east coast right now too....</span><br>
<br>
NEXT<br>
<br>
<span class="babyBlue"><br>
A business owner, and former FEDish person, talking about Trump and whatever this array of policies is that are being implemented.  It sounds like there is some coordination.<br>
<br>
"She" gave the cue for the mask thing with the brown lung thing which all textile workers have to deal with.  And there was talk on my screen about pollen events in Alaska.  Yeah, we had them in Virgina Beach too, but I'm kinda just ride through that.<br>
<br>
You know, too much is too much, but a little is OK.  Each seed is like coated with that stuff like the bark of a tree.</span><br>

My "other" <u>instance</u> of firefox with the dexter town hall keeps timing out from lack of activity because it doesn't have "the focus".<br>

right?<br>

Don't get paranoid.  Like Miss Rand knows anything about it....</span><br>

It's good to know your neighbors.  It's just not a constitutional law to know your neighbors.  At least not yet....<br>
<br>
right?<br>
<br>
Well, if the something caught on fire here with the white rubber coated wires in the wall, then the alarm going off and not stopping may alert a neighbor?  It may not the the team here to help me off the floor and onto the bed again, but it may alert my neighbors to exit and call the professionals, whether they know me well or not....</span><br>
<br>
NEXT....<br>
<br>
<span class="pink"><br>
WATER<br>
Yeah, overpopulation matters there, ABSOLUTELY.  It's likely not all that much of a racial war except for the eugenics of the births we do have themselves.  Not that that is a law either.  You know, 25% of 8 billion is still two bits billion.</span><br>
<br>
Just gotta do my best to the the math with the numbers correct.  I am fairly good at the formulas....</span><br>

Trust in a money we don't even use anymore?  How will it work?<br>

Why would we do it?  Well, why did we do all of this?  Because we could.<br>
<br>
Like the Fringe Album title "Because they can." The Gonz.  <a target="rlr4" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+fringe+because+they+can+the+gonz+saxophone&sca_esv=c7a34cb64741ffad&biw=716&bih=987&sxsrf=ANbL-n7JdVbLwLvEpSoPhsSLLUBmlLOxSQ%3A1770862960059&ei=cDmNabOZA5HE0PEPwILS0As&ved=0ahUKEwizkbjN8tKSAxURIjQIHUCBFLoQ4dUDCBM&uact=5&oq=the+fringe+because+they+can+the+gonz+saxophone&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiLnRoZSBmcmluZ2UgYmVjYXVzZSB0aGV5IGNhbiB0aGUgZ29ueiBzYXhvcGhvbmUyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigAUiCElDiBFjVEHABeACQAQCYAd0CoAHrCaoBBzAuMi4xLjK4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgWgAsMHwgILEAAYgAQYsAMYogTCAggQABiwAxjvBcICBRAhGKsCmAMAiAYBkAYEkgcHMS4xLjIuMaAH-CCyBwcwLjEuMi4xuAe-B8IHBTAuMS40yAcYgAgA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" class="babyBlue">here?</a><br>

Is it still a conflict of interest?  What is help?  Nylons?  Enough jet fuel?  Ship the end state clothing machines to each locality around the world and then ship the cotton once a year?  Bolts of fabric in each nation?  How heavy will it be?<br>
<br>
What color is the train fuel?  It can't be just batteries, right?  Nuclear trains?  Do we ship bananas via 747?</span><br></div>

I was running some logic tests on how many votes could be faked in an election and go under the radar.  It's a thing of "did you vote for them?"  If there are enough citizens that did not, the rumors would spread that something doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
But then again, it's kind of like did you hear what the band played a few minutes ago?  Well, there is no recording....</span><br>
<br>
NEXT<br>
<br>
<span class="pink"><br>
Airspace?<br>
<br>
Abstractions?<br>
<br>
It sure seems weird, right?  If all the cars stopped moving and I got the write in votes needed....  If I won both the DEM and REP write in vote, well, people here may be like "YES, I wrote her in too."  And then it goes to the courts.  "Can she win both parties?"  Well, no, perhaps I can only win the REP nomination, right?  Does it matter to me?  US?<br>
</span><br>
<br>
NEXT<br>
<br>
<span class="pink"><br>
Yeah, Timothy McVie, right?  That is how you spell that?  Hadn't really thought of that in a long, long time.  Not every 20 year old can piece all these things together.<br>
<br>
I connect the dots, I don't place them on the field.  Some of them others do, but certainly not all of them.<br>
<br>
The paranoia end of it all.  Tell me about it.  Her about it.<br>
<br>
I was thinking last night that perhaps people can and will keep using Bitcoin to trade household items.  I'm willing to bet it may be more barter goods for goods.  Maybe an online multi-market of I want this, I have these things, other people want one of them, then it prints the shopping list of where to go to do the trade itself.  And I can get a little exercise and meet some lovely people.  And get a blender and pie dish.<br>
<br>
But I don't have anything when the ball fell....</span><br>

Q: How should the 11 2024 US DEM Presidential candidates spend their $200,000 / year?  Salary for yourself?  Others?  Printing?  Payroll?  501c3 setup?  Push the legal factors of running a business?  Campaign or prepare for the job itself?</span><br>
<br>
Of course Big Money is in D and "a lot of useless talk" ends on an A.  What do you know, not only did I sing it in the "right" key, but I also pushed the right fingers down on the holes of the Archon's tubes.<br>
<br>
Q: How do I play 24+ notes with just 6 holes?</span><br></div>

Uh, this has been going on for me for years....</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
I get a SIM card in the mail just now.  The little instructions say to depower my phone and insert the card.  I'm like "I'll need to get the gold bass string to pop it out." And then a like ambulance siren starts blaring.  Their rig is passing my on the street right there.<br>
<br>
Timed dog barks?  Yeah, I'm obviously imagining things and not taking the "right pill".  You know how taking their medications has a way of avoiding nervous breakdowns, right?<br>
<br>
I'm sure just about anyone is "compatible" with me, right?  It's just weird like that.  Amazing of course....</span><br>

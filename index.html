Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

* from Geddy Lee's <i>My Effin' Life</i>.  I was named after uncle Rand who died from the sailboat boom arm and my maternal grandfather, Ralph, died trying to save him.  Just heard the full story in 2023.<br>
<br>
<br>
I should go easier on myself.  I always come up with these grand ideas for breaking through in some way politically.  I'll write a better book.  Compose and record some better music.  Go door to door with a new book or some pamphlets.  Hold out a better sign.  The newest idea is to only go to doors with some variation of a transgender flag.<br>
<br>
Or workup a new routine to perform music in a coffee shop.  That I can break down my personal fears about asking the management in person if I can become their one and only musician.  That I could perform there randomly and not have to do excessive gear moves every day.  I'll just record my chop sticks drumming and acoustic bass playing at home in the middle of the night and play it on some speakers there so people can hear it over all the chit chat or clinking beer mugs.  And then I can play keyboard, whistle  flute and REACH dental floss shaker with it.<br>
<br>
But perhaps it'll never work anyway?  It would feel good to have publically declared support on my FEC.gov page.  I'll of course be doing something.  It's difficult to disconnect from the torture of trying to gain approval after so many decades of failures.<br>

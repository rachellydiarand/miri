I get haunted by this guy calling my music "musical masturbation".  Of course it was meant to degrade me.  As an insult.  And it's not just that one guy.  I get it all the time.<br>
<br>
But I stick up for myself and my musical art.<br>
<br>
I have a day job.  Even my professional music in the US Navy was a day job of sorts.  I'm retired from professional music the same way I'm retired from professional software engineering.<br>
<br>
My "day job" is US President.  I'm just a candidate.  It's a crazy high level gig and we can have as few as 3 of them every sixteen years when you include the vice-president.  My presidential candidate gig is not paid yet, but neither was music or software engineering before I started making money at those.  These are ALL high level careers which require many, many years of schooling before making any money at them.  I'm perpetually a presidential candidate, for the rest of my life essentially.  I may go back to doing some light programming for some cash.  I may do a crazy high level music gig for millions of dollars if it comes up.<br>
<br>
It's business as usual, right?  My music, my way.  I like the idea of there being one musician on each US Navy ship.  Kind of randomly playing around the ship.  With or without electronics.  People getting to know you.  One live musician on a city bus.  I like things like that.  Would you rather see one live musician 30 times a year or one band of musicians 2 times a year?  If there were no music recordings at all?<br>
<br>
What does it matter?  Do you want live music or group music?  Do you support live musicians or do you support group musicians?  Do you support people?<br>
<br>
Hey, I grew up in a single player video arcade environment.  My grandmother played solitaire.  I like solitaire and single player arcade games.  That is MY CULTURE.  Leave my culture alone.  Go get your own or adopt mine.  Stop giving me grief over my culture.  Just stop that.<br>

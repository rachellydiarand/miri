Negotiating is on my mind this evening....<br>
<br>
I have super poor negatiating skills and my ability to initiate negoatiations is almost non-existant.  I am certainly way different than President Trump on that point.<br>
<br>
I'm just pure scientist I think.  Even with music.  I could apply my scientific curiosity to negoatiation, but negotiation seems so, well, it's just a dang weird subject for me.<br>
<br>
It's that negotiation is supposedly about making your situation, usually financial situation, better.  It's such an odd subject for me that I'm not even sure what to say about it or what my blocker is on it.  Perhaps I would do better at it politically because it wouldn't be about MY situation?<br>
<br>
It's just people weirdness to me I guess.  Perhaps it is because I have been robbed so hard and held back from being able to manage others.  People probably see me as weak, like a weak negotiator.  Yeah, that is likely it.  I'm weak in the weight lifting way and weak as a negotiator.  I don't stand up for my financial situation.  Or do I?  What can I do about it?  Is it because of guilty feelings about my fluffy acid jazz solo trombone career and then desk job freelance software programming?<br>
<br>
About not being masculine?<br>
<br>
I don't know.  This is the way I am.  You certainly wouldn't be hiring me, appointing me, as president for my raw negotating skills.  You see our President in those videos flying around the world and sitting with other leaders shaking hands and signing papers and talking about some likely negotation.  You look at me and think "She'll never be able to do that."  And you know, you'll mostly correct.<br>
<br>
Yet I seem to be connected to the top of the world order and feel that I am the poster child of "Leader of the Free World".  Do leaders negotiate?  Do you negotate with your favorite musician?  Don't fans typically write notes to their favorite musicians saying "I loved how you put that first and second song together on your third album!  It always brings up a feeling of inspiration and drives me through my workday.  Thanks for doing that!"<br>
<br>
It's not a thing of "I didn't like how you went to the four chord there.  Why didn't you think to go to the three minor and then the four minor?"  Yet that seems to be more of the norm in politics than not.<br>
<br>
Sex, politics and religion are not political correct, but music and sports fans are.  We love musicians and athletes.  Some more than others, but it's almost universal that people do not like politicians.  Some people say they support politicians, but do they really?  I've seen that most people who are supportive of a politician or even political party, are supportive because they feel their policies will put more money in their account.  The opposite is true with music fans.<br>

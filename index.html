Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

<h4>2025-12-16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09:56:08 AM</h4>
It's a frustrating day.<br>
<br>
Taking a deep breath.  Of course, I don't know what this is, but perhaps my 4+ books are simply not good enough yet.  My music isn't good enough yet.  My software isn't good enough yet.<br>
<br>
I should grow up and stop chasing young women.  I should accept that I am OK being a single transwoman president.  I should accept that they may kill me at any moment for any reason.<br>
<br>
That I am not in control on some level.<br>
<br>
That I have my limitations.  That I have had to learn about discrimination, even more.  That I may not be president.  That the world may not go through this change in my lifetime.<br>
<br>
I have come a long way.  This social media stuff is driving me crazy.  But I have enjoyed it.  There seem to be some lovely caring people out there.  I'm sick to death of chasing success.  Trying to reach out to people.  Obviously I'm not good at it.<br>
<br>
Whether I am social enough to be president or not is not really my call.  I don't know.  I've trained for this for decades, so I remain at the ready.  As best as I can.  It's a reboot of sorts.  Perhaps people will come around to accepting me and my limitations some day?  There are some lovely people out there.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Rachel<br></div>

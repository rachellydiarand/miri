Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

I used to walk to the corner store which was about 6 blocks away from home to play arcade games in like 1979-1984.  Space Invaders.  Ms Pac-Man.  Donkey Kong.  Asteroids.  QiX.  Mario Bros.  Track and Field.  Tempest.  Games like those.  I love these games.<br>
<br>
My best friend and I, in high school, would go to the nickel arcades.  Although we had fun at them, I preferred the smaller places.  My dad would take us to the MGM Grand in Reno Nevada about once a year.  I would play some games there in a small room or something like that.  I don't think I've ever placed a bet in a casino.<br>
<br>
My dad, his brother and father, were avid gamblers.  Card playing and going to the horse and greyhound races.  Although I enjoyed that at the time, those activities did not follow me into adult life.<br>
<br>
But the arcade games and computers did.  I've never recorded my music on tape except for 2 short experiments in my youth.</span><br>

I'm a digital native.<br>
<br>
My friends and I bought used jazz records in high school.  I would record some of them onto tape to play in the car.  I practically never listened to the radio in the car.  I know a good deal of the early MTV music, but by the late 1980's, I stopped consuming it.</span><br>

Hello!
<br>

<br>
<div class="pink">
<br>
I'm a Generation X person.  I was born in 1971.
<br>

<br>
I saw Nirvana a couple times on MTV.  Like that unplugged thing and of course that main video they did.  Just a couple times though.  That's about all I know about them.
<br>

<br>
Essentially the newest TV show I've seen is 24 with Jack Bauer.  I watched it a few times.  I saw the Matrix Trilogy in about 2010.  The last movie I saw in the Theater was Men in Black 3.  Before that was WALL-E.  Before that, well, it may have been Mad Max Thunderdome in like 1990.  I saw that on opening day.

It's 1-6-26 today.  Kind of order 66 day in my world.  Watching Star Wars Episodes III and VI.  Both have half completed Death Stars.  I was thinking yesterday that once we stop industrialism like I've been saying, we'll want people to just walk off the job site and never come back.  Just leave it there as an example of a half built skyscraper.<br>
<br>
It's like we are the dinosauers and these buildings are our pyramids.  I've been having fun thinking of future generations of humans scrapping through all these buildings.  Fun to think about run down industrialism on that level.<br>
<br>
It seems that industrialism was a one time shot.  We wanted to see what we could do.<br>

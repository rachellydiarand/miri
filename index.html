Look, they have been shaming presidents for using famous musician's music as part of their campaign for like my entire life.  But they probably don't play it solo on multiple instruments and vocals like I do, right?<br>

Look, animals are amazing!  We are crazy amazing creatures!  This is all just work stuff.  Except for my transgenderism of course.  I'm a transwoman.  The is my history and present.  Even that has been good political work, but it's also a keeper for my personally.<br>

Obviously, I am experiencing grandious delusions because I have not been taking medications for a couple years.
<br>

<br>
All this mental health stuff with me is completely incorrect.  I am not delusional in any way.  This is actual, real world politics.  The math I did on the streets in 2004, which you can see in this image with my trombone, obviously works incredibly well.  I wrote the code of that on paper in a mental hospital while be given medication that was making it hard for me to work.
<br>

<br>
You can see just from my SSA earnings statement what I have been through.  Yes, it's mostly about people in politics, but we live in a MATERIAL WORLD.  A highly industrial material world.  Our lives are completely dependent on electricity, rubber and roads.  And metal.  We CANNOT survive at this level of population without those elements and of course they will not last forever.
<br>

<br>
My life is sensational.  I'm working under duress.  A rape and torture victim.  Still full of hope and not in despair.  I'm working the problem AND asking for help in the best way I can.  Can you help?  I especially need a research assistant.  And money of course.  USDA/SNAP EBT cards are going to be the backbone of our new economy.  World wide.  That is what the true meaning of LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD is.  80% unemployment without hardship.  I'm mostly concerned that men will get too bored.  It's a good problem to have overall.
<br>

<br>
We're having fun, right?  What a time to be alive, right?

Good morning!  How was your sleep?
<br>

<br>
I've realized lately that lightening is moving through a path in the air.  It's either nitrogen or oxygen.  They say it's nitrogen.  That it kinda breaks them apart on the way down.  It's got to have a continuous connection to the grounding element though.
<br>

<br>
Hurricanes and typhoons travel east to west following the sun.  They say that the tip of South Africa is at the 32 degree parallel and the tip of South America is at the 40th parallel?  Or is it 50th?  I think It's 50 degrees and New Zealand is 40 degrees.  I've been to Capetown and around the Cape Horn.
<br>

<br>
They say that the winds whip around the bottom of the world something fierce because of the small amount of land.
<br>

<br>
The deal with the Superman II movie and Lex Luther wanting "Austrailia" in return for his work is interesting!  Interesting how it looks like oxidized metal on Google Earth.  It's likely true.

Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div>

<br>
People like to talk politics about all kinds of social things.  I get it.  People put a lot of work into all these structures and utilities around here.
<br>

<br>
If we are going to ratchet down industrialism in a non "triangular wave" pattern, like liberty bell curve pattern, then that likely means:
<br>

<br>
1. Decreasing oil refining.  This has to be a linear fashion.  There would be less of every product of the distilation column.
<br>

<br>
2. Likely ending residential natural gas.  I know, this is a bummer.
<br>

<br>
3. Less asphalt.  We may be able to get it straight from "tar sands" in Canada.  I've seen reports about that.  It sounds like they are soaking them in water to extract oil from them currently.  There are some other indicators in my environment about this.
<br>

<br>
4. Abandoning paving some roads.
<br>

<br>
5. Ceasing most new housing construction.
<br>

<br>
6. Limited hardware supplies for remodeling.
<br>

<br>
7. Continued food and clothing of course.  The limiting factor to all of this is that we have to keep diesel gas going for commercial traffic.  And we need gas for people to get to the store and essential workers.
<br>

<br>
8. Limited air travel most likely.
<br>

<br>
9. Online ordering of any new products from the "industrial machine".  Local pickup may be a thing, but it certainly won't be the "browsing the isles" that we have seen for all of eternity.  You'll likely need some kind of online authorization.  Electric Amazon trucks aren't massively dependent on the distilation column, right?
<br>

<br>

<br>
As you can see, if this is happening, this is a MAJOR world change.  Population decline goes along with this.  We essentially took all the good oil, bananas, rubber and other exotic products from those highly productive areas of the planet and moved them around.  This depleated top soil in all those regions which reduces output of any new products.  We have this problem everywhere.
<br>

<br>
Population decline is key and my transgenderism isn't really a WAY TO DECREASE POPULATION.  Ya know?  It's just my style of living folks.  Yeah, I do this loopy music thing.  But I do politics for a living.  I haven't made money at it yet, but it's likely going to happen here soon.  I sure hope it is, cause wow, I have put a lot of work into this and if you only knew all the signals I am getting from my life of training.  It is blinding weirdness these stories of my life.
<br>

<br>
Fun stuff too though!  It looks like Sting is having some fun!  Hey, I'm a different person, right?  Go a little easy on me.  I am a torture victim.
<br>

<br>
OK, scones came out of the oven!  Thank you John Kanell!
<br>

<br>
10. Shoe rubber.  Whether is is latex or a distalation column product, this stuff was good for running and better than those leather shoes.  Perhaps the marijuana thing is for those groovy hemp wedge sandal heels?  And welcome mats?  It's also good for incense.

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.
<br>

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.  That is my opinion on my professional life.</span>

I keep on musing on the Radar character on M*A*S*H.  Perhaps that is the only male role model I have in life?  Not that I'm looking for a male role model at all.  I'm sick to death of male music role models and was never into sports.  Radar just makes sense to me like that.
<br>

But you know.  I do me and you do you.  It's best like that.</div>

I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.

I made some freaky good posts on reddit today.  And then I opened my direct messages there and the moderators said that they will not unban me from "learnprogramming".  They said that I violated their rules, one of which was to ask someone to help me with some coding.<br>
<br>
I resonded with I do not agree.  I was trying to share my decades of experience with people.  I am trying to teach.  That is the true nature of "employing" a volunteer intern, right?  Like me saying build a dot object for my presidential campaign?  Hey, I've certainly got skin in the game.  They were in school.  Likely paying for school, right?  So now they can volunteer with me for ROOM AND BOARD.  That's a step up from paying for school, no?<br>

It's not my job to house homeless people.  If you need a place to live, you are homeless, then I suggest that instead of knocking on my door, and instead of protesting, you hold a sign out like I have been, a BIG CARDBOARD SIGN with WHITE PRINTER PAPER taped to it, that says "RAND not PAUL 4 President".  If we get people like that on multiple street corners throughout the city, it would be a more peaceful campaign than your typical gathering crowd that we simply hear about on the news.<br>
<br>
Protests are more like concerts.  You don't even really know they are going on unless you are right there in your car trying to get past the obstruction to go to work.  It's simply better when it is DISPERSED.<br>
<br>
Isn't this proof that I have indeed been working?  I didn't get this out of a text book although I must say that the sociology class I took at Portland Community College in 1992 did spark some interest in all of this.<br>
<br>
You know, buy my book.  Support me.  Suport yourself.  I'm only one person.<br>

I'm not trying to create some orgy scene at my little(ish) apartment.  The idea is that we'll live together as this tight knit team, like we are working in the White House or any kinda close knit on the road place and then we'll be supported BIG TIME and we'll just buy a mansion with cash, right?  Like soon.<br>
<br>
I can't promise that, but my life is that big and it would be no surprise at all.<br>
<br>
Or it might become a crisis and I'll still be alone and they'll give me all the millions and then I'll have to find someone to trust.<br>
<br>
I guess I don't make bold moves on it because it really doesn't matter to me all that much.  It could be a bit of a missed opportunity for people in my environment that I have small interactions with.  I've had plenty of those through the years too.<br>
</div><br>
<br>
Perhaps there is some hard sexual element to this though.  The problem for me is that this is so dang huge, I have no idea how to make decisions like this.  I love the monolog I do.  This is working.  I hate the financial stress of it all.  It's not about the money itself.  I do this crazy high level work and no one recognizes it and I get threatend with eveiction and starvation.  It's not fun like that.  The rejection of it.<br>
<br>
I get paranoid.  "Is it because I am transgender?"  And then it doesn't matter because I will not change that.  But it's not even fair entertaining that question.  It's discrimination.<br>
<br>
Rejection.<br>
<br>
Group rejection and my trying to fix the problem.  To find this introvert, sober group.  And have a good romanitc intimate relationship.  And get this business done.<br>

Some people, or even a majority of people, may think that my mission to fill these three positions is a joke, but I'm crazy serious about it.  That research position is dang important to me and the other two are as well.<br>
<br>
It's not a hunt for a romantic partner, but there is that aspect to it as well.  My life is huge and complicated obviously.  I'm likely way different than YOUR next door neighbor.<br>
<br>
The comedy political monolog music show is also a thing.  I'm not interested in becoming the next Johnny Carson with the good 'ol jazz orchestra on the side of the stage.  I mean, is that what it is?  Night after night?  I have NEVER had a vision of my life becoming that.  I never wanted to do live gigs.  I'm sick to death of group music.  There is some desire to interview people like that.<br>
<br>
BUT....<br>
<br>
If this is not about the end of industrialism and the business of that and my business job within it, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT IT.  I'm not an emerging musician like that.  This must be dang huge.  Like me as the Leader of the Free World (the whole world) in the end of Industrialism switch.<br>

I'd say that it's not unreasonable to think that the republicans may contribute a few million to me right off the bat.  I have had an extreme lack of power in my business life.  It's all been great lessons, but it is a show me the money type of thing.  Or it will be a simply show me the votes thing.  But yes, I'll need contributions here.  This is a weird campaign finance study I'm doing.</div><br></div>

<div class="babyBlue">Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div><br>

I'm in this mode of redefining, yet again, what kind of help I am seeking.  For campaign volunteers, I guess standing out with a MS RAND FOR PRESIDENT sign and taking a picture of you in your little scene there and doing that once a day, five days a week, for a whole month would be good enough for me to get that EBT/SNAP credit of $298/month.  I'd sign off on that.  The USDA/DHS/SNAP system wants 20 hours/week.<br>
<br>
Research last night said that Kamala Harris had one billion dollars in contributions and President Trump had 3 million.  President Trump obviously does not need the money.  I certainly need a little money.  I need dental floss, a new kitchen sponge, I'm getting low on pink shaving cream.  Toothpaste.  I need MONEY for this stuff.  Your handout BS is simply not good enough.  I'm working way too hard, way too selfless to take that BS people.<br>
<br>
I hate being mad like this, buy you all have brought it on.  I hate, HATE this strip club, hazing culture in AMERICA.  FUCKING HATE IT.<br>
<br>
Don't you have any class?<br>
<br>
Anyway.  Sorry about the hate.  It should be interesting to see what happens with professional sports when there is no money or transportation.</div><br></div>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.
<br>

<br>
Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

I've been on SSD before and got off of it and made a million dollars afterward.

I'm in need.  I really am.  And I'm working excessively hard at becoming employed, again.  I have need for a reasonable accomodation.  I really do.</div>

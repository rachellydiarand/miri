The personal connections in my life story just keep getting more and more rich, yet I'm all alone.  Why was this done?<br>
<br>
My best guess is that my body configuration, personality, real world education and musical skills are a tool to perform politics on camera on the internet in a mostly solo format.  You'll know it's me on camera.  It's obviously easy to alter a few letters and numbers on a screen.  We can certainly alter every last frame of a video as well, but there is no need to get super paranoid about it.<br>
<br>
Like the end of the movie <i>Contact</i> where Ellie suggests "search for your own answers".  I'm certainly capable of playing with most famous musicians on the spot in a session type arrangement live, but I'd say a good deal of my political and musical future is solo.  I can't help but love what I do!<br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

If people want me to be president, they will come to me.  I don't have to go to heroics anymore.  I've done the work.  I've got to take care of my health as best as I can.  I've got software to write.  Music to make.  Books to write.  Research to complete.</div><br>

You know, I'm not really a tough person at all.  Gay, wuss, all of that actually fits me ok.  I'm not one of the "in" crowd.  I'm an outsider.  A misfit.  Absolutely.<br>
<br>
I feel like changing my title to "Miss Rand for President".  I'm a "miss".  Available.  Traditional.  I'm sick to death of feminism.  But then we are all kind of mixed up now in a late stage industrialism.  We're diverse.  I'd do well with a female partner.  A young female partner who wants, desires to be a traditional housewife too.  That's the lesbian couple thing going on with me.<br>
<br>
Or being picked up by a guy who will just take care of all this madness around me so I can do my thing.  I don't know what you would call that type of relationship.<br>
<br>
I'm fine with being single too.  I just want the insanity to stop.  Can I use the laundry machines where I live now?  Is it just training because we are not going to be making many more of these machines?<br>

I'm under high stress obviously.<br>
<br>
I feel like I've been gravely wounded.  I've got this leaky gut type condition.<br>
<br>
I'll likely not a get a tattoo.  I'll likely kill myself if I get fat.  I don't have a problem with eating meat.  I don't have a problem with excercising.  Obviously.  I'm a transwoman.  If I'm going to die, then of course I would just like a bunch of strong men to rape me and mortally wound me in the end.<br>
<br>
Is president Trump building a ballroom for me?  The T2 movie starts off with 2029.  I'd even drink beer if it helped.  I'd do drugs too to remain thin.  Drugs, exercise.  I don't particularlly want to get muscular, but if I was to remain thin and hold my feminine sexy edge, then that's ok.  I suppose there are back tattoos, right?  I can't see my own back.<br>
<br>
I'm insane obviously.  Mosty from extreme poverty.  I used my bathtowel to clean up sausage off the sidewalk this morning and then threw it in the dumpster.<br>
<br>
The things people have done to me are disgusting.  I have no idea how people can stoop so low.  It's incomprehensible to me.<br>

Q: Does the president play in a band?<br>
<br>
A: Naw, the president is kinda a solo act.  But then again, she does have a fling with the RUSHnerds....</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Who is the fourth member of <i>RUSH</i>?<br>
<br>
A: Well, it's kind of a thing of because Geddy Lee is spread so thin that the keyboard doesn't HAVE to be played all the time, on every song.<br>

Good morning!  How was your sleep?<br>
<br>
It's an interesting process I'm in.  Trying to figure out the truths of society and our chemical lives.  I made a nice biryani the other day, so I'm trying again!  I like the process.  I made scones yesterday.  I know they are not great for my body, but I enjoy making them and eating them.<br>
<br>
I have a pretty long list of paranoias about society now.  I've got to live my own life and truth here.  I am standing up for my social identity being "traditional housewife".  I'm certainly not "attracted to men".  I see their value.  Their traditional value.  I fantasize about sex with them.  I've had sex with them and envision next time being better, but it isn't a have to kind of thing.  I am attracted to women but I don't know how attractive to them I am.  And I'm not going to change myself for someone.  It's very much a "she said, she said" situation over here.<br>
<br>
It was like this with Cynthia except I was "still in the closet".  It's a thing of a transwoman with a woman in my life, if there is any more romance in my life which is certainly my vote.  I'm just way too much of a muse to not try to form another relationship.  I could do Captain Kirk mode too.  I'm mostly a stay at home housewife though looking for a stay at home, child free, housewife.  We can split chores.  With my emerging professional political work, it may be more traditional roles mostly in many ways.<br>
<br>
I just want to enter the senate in my best dresses.  Definitely looking forward to a nice, traditional, leather purse now.  I've never had a leather purse.  I figure that I'll have a purse for my things like nail cutters, pens, ids, small writing book.  And then a soft leather tote for the 85.x11's.<br>
<br>
OK.  It's 12:53am.  I got good sleep through the evening.  Got Real Genius with no sound on in the bedroom.  Computer and music out in the living room again.  Biryani in the kitchen.  Plenty of work to do.  Made some progress out in the world yesterday but less than 100% success.  You win some you lose some, right?  2nd place in 8 billion is still pretty good!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
Rachel</span><br></div>

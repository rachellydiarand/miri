* <i>Remember what is going on here with me.  "Adults" will not help my campaign apparently, so I'm counting on young people to step up and I am offering Food Benefits and room and board for a few people.  Like in an official capacity.  It's like the military and I am actually counting on the military itself to back me up in this.  Not even kidding about that.</i><br>

So, interesting ideas about relationships and families this morning.  The TV show <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> is yet again coming in handy with showing some true nature about romantic relationships.<br>
<br>
There is the Half Pint and Manley taboo relationship.  Half pint was like 14 years old and she was interested in like a 27 year old and gave him the nicname "Manley".  They wound up being a lovely couple.<br>
<br>
Then there is Nellie, who was the hellraiser brat kid of the town with her parents Harriet and Nells who owned and operated the only store in town.  It was disfunctional all the way around as Harriet ran wild and Nells had no control over her.  My thoughts are that Nells just loved his work so much he put up with it all.  He did his best, but there was no power on his end and that was kinda like why I left Ann, and was the end of my relationship with Ena as well.  I can only take so much!<br>
<br>
But then a nice Jewish, like college graduate, Percival came to town and got involved with Nellie.  He was able to put her in her place and it was just so cute and right!  Nells was very appreciative although I wouldn't say it did much to change Harriet.<br></div>

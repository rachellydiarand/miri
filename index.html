The emperor's made a critical error... and the time for our attack has come.<br>
<br>
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies... pinpoint the exact location... of the emperor's new battle station.<br>
<br>
We also know that the w*apon systems of this Death Star... are not yet operational.<br>
<br>
With the imperial fleet... spread throughout the galaxy... in a vain effort to engage us... it is relatively unprotected.<br>
<br>
But most important of all... we've learned that the emperor himself... is personally overseeing the final stages... of the construction of this Death Star.<br>
<br>
Many Bothans died to bring us this information.<br>

Q: Was the Holocaust fake?  It feels like Geddy Lee is telling the truth.  I know I am telling the truth that my mom had some kind of deep rooted depression.  The story from my mom's side of the family is that I got my middle name from Uncle Rand who died on the family sailboat when my mom and her sister were young teenagers, in the early 1950's.  And my grandfather Ralph dove into the water in an attempt to save him and they both died.<br>
<br>
It must have been traumatic.  My mom, her sister and my grandmother, on the nice family sailboat with some friends of the family, and then all the sudden, tradgedy and all the males in the family are dead, instantly.  Their lives, going so strong, were completely changed, immediately.<br>
<br>
There was a gallon of Cutty Sark whisky in the bottom kitchen cabinet.  Dad was a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous from before I was born.  Never drank.  My mom would take a shot of whisky like once every few years.  The dark gray sailboat picture up on the mantle above the fireplace in the living room and it was just a for show type room with two loveseat couches and a coffee table.<br>
<br>
And Geddy Lee tells a similar story.<br>
<br>
And my brother was gang raped in a dungeon type place for two days when he was 14 years old and then died from his injuries at the age of 48.<br>
<br>
My house with Ann Argodale was at 4848 Shore Drive in Virginia Beach Virginia and now I'm running for US President #48, by attempting to win the primary to the US Senate in 2026 by getting hundreds of thousands of write in votes across the state of Oregon.<br>
<br>
I feel this insane pressure.  Is this real?  Am I the authority on this end of industrialism?  Is ego really bad?  What is confidence?</span><br></div>

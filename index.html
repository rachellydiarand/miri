I believe that each presidency is a unique job.</div><br>
<div class="pink"><br>
I believe that I don't have to be as well informed as most other presidents likely are.  If society is going to do this industrialism draw down close to what I am suggesting, then I'm simply a good person to lead the effort technically.  If you'd be doing it without me anyway, you may want me leading the effort because of my unique social history and certainly my computer and business skills.</div><br>
<div class="babyBlue"><br>
I'm certainly a cheerleader for people to study music at home during these years of massive unemployment.  We all have our style and preferences.  I'm a solo musician.  I may be extremely inspiring for people to study music on their own.  Some people can benefit from that.  Others can't.  I can't help everyone in that way.</div><br>
<div class="pink"><br>
This healthcare debate is stupid.  I believe we do not have the latex rubber to be driving much in the future and with decreasing population, slashing healthcare is the obvious choice.  People appear to be using it way too much.  The high workload for doctors makes it crazy impersonal with them filling their day with people they barely know.  They listen to you and then go to their back room and try to notate it all down, but they often completely transcribe your words incorrectly.  And then they prescribe you medications based on that input.</div><br>
<div class="babyBlue"><br>
And oftentimes, it's simply environmental like bad airflow in your bedroom.</div><br></div>

Look, that idea of the Jiffy Lube or mattress store sign wavers is probably OK, but this putting signs on the poles is NOT OK.  I had some people a couple years ago saying they would do this type of advertising for me, but I avoided it because I don't believe in it.  I may take pictures of all these signs and petition the city to prosecute them.  It's litter and bad for the poles not to mention a huge negative trigger for some people.

<br>
I have no idea why people enjoy music and TV in restaurants.  It destroys the intimacy and romance.  I certainly have intimacy and romance in my dining room most of the time and that is where I prefer to spend the majority of MY TIME.

If people are leaving trash all around me because they think I am a trashy transwoman, then please, please send me a note and buy my book.  I really don't want to be out on the streets anyway.

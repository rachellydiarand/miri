<b>Rachel's "Working Base" Declarations:</b><br>
<br>
1. My housing is stable - They have been threatening to take my housing away, but my apartment/home has a street address number instead of a unit number on it.  If my best friend Sam's life story is mostly true, then they have allowed him to buy two different houses with VA and SSA benefits and had done nothing more professionally than working at a clothing store for a couple years.  So, with me doing what I did, it is reasonable that they will not question me about my housing anymore.  And anyway, they dismissed the eviction proceeding against me in court and they would have to start that again which would go on for another 6 months.  I'm just staying here to the end anyway at this point.  It's a stable base to start from.<br>
<br>
2. Food - I have news in my phone news feed that says that President Trump has put some raised work requirement for the able bodied adult without dependents work requirement from age 53 to 65.  It could all be fake news, then again, maybe not.  But the only reason I qualify for that right now is because I'm 54.  It has meant that I don't have to report my work search activities to them.  So I contacted the DHS office and am declaring the work search activities I have been doing all year sporadically because you know how I am about record keeping.  And writing letters.  I declared to them that I am an employer with an EIN and that I can have people volunteering with my company, Ms Rand for President, to meet that work requirement to get those EBT/SNAP benefits.  If this house place is mine and I can continue getting those benefits and am able to have others living with me and receiving those benefits because they are doing legitimate work for me, then I'm going to do that.  The problem is whether I can trust them or not.  And that is a huge problem for me, but you have to trust someone at some point or you have nothing in this human world.  It's kind of a "see it in their eyes" type of thing.<br>
<br>
3. There is this Taylor Swift song that I have been listening to, the only one I have ever heard of hers.  It's called "Do it with a broken heart".  "You know you are good if you can do it with a broken heart."  Well, yeah, tell me about it.  I'm crazy psychotic about it.  I get down, but then I get back up quickly.  It's not like I'm going to forget how to play 13 musical instruments suddenly.  Or forget how to code software.  Give an eager 22 year old a million dollars with a contract to make a record in the next year and see what happens.  I never had an opportunity like that.  sure, there was that job interview thing at FaceBook for a $775,000/year job when I started my Ms Rand for President in 2023, but I had no clear idea of what they wanted me to do and it wasn't even a contract.  What is holding me back musically is having to run all over town each day for food, laundry, presidential legal work.<br>
<br>
4. I'm just flat out excited about having people volunteer with me, but I'm completely socially disabled.  A tortured social prisoner.  It's reasonable to assume that there are some men out there who raised nympho daughters and would absolutely love them to be with me.  That is what I am looking for.  Females are just dang healing like that and I'm a crazy rock star who never had this true experience.  I'm sure it was part of the plan.  Not sure how to get "her".  Right?  I'm also a transwoman and this is a bit of lesbian thing because I want to be the center of attention too!  :-)  I'm a crazy big rock star like that.  Complete paradox of course.  The No Kings signs are just as disturbing to me as the BLM signs.  I've absolutely got the ego of a King in search of a young white woman.  Sorry if that bothers you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Things are going pretty good though all things considered.  Not sure what will turn things around here, but I'm trying to force some serenity around the idea that I am safe and stable here.  I consider all of my neighbors to be secret service and it is not my place AT ALL to reach out to them.  They guard the door and handle ground operations that I am not aware of.  That's how they work.  Things work well here, I'm just scared because, well, because they have made me scared through humiliation and degrading my health.  I can't tell if they are killing me, if this is a death row records deal and not about politics, or if it is just like I am saying.<br>
<br>
I need people on board with me, physically.  I am not capable of reaching out to people.  People become fans of musicians and presidents.  Show your support.<br>
<br>
right?<br>

Sorry.  The church this is just pure torture for me.  Bars too.  It's ok, right?  I'm not the only zen leaning person in America, right?  We've got business work to do with our economy.  There is seperation of church and state.  The constituion and all of that.  Exposing my culture is torturous for me because I am quite different from the norm around here.  But I most certainly do represent some people.<br>
<br>
OK, I'll press on with the campaign here.  It's torture of course.  Odd times that we are living in.  It seems like a huge world change is upon us and I'm in some kind of massive leadership position in it.  I ranked #8 of the 14 official US Presidential Democratic candidates in 2024.  #8 in total contributions.  $55,000.  All my own money made from skills I learned while living on the streets of Seattle 2004.<br>

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.
<br>

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.  That is my opinion on my professional life.</span>

Good morning!</div>

I keep on musing on the Radar character on M*A*S*H.  Perhaps that is the only male role model I have in life?  Not that I'm looking for a male role model at all.  I'm sick to death of male music role models and was never into sports.  Radar just makes sense to me like that.
<br>

<br>
But you know.  I do me and you do you.  It's best like that.</div>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.

Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

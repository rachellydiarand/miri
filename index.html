Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

I'm just being tortured by the thought "What do you want?"  Well, I want donations.  Contributions.  For my EXTENSIVE POLITICAL WORK.  So I can purchase NORMAL things.  Like a sponge for the kitchen and to be able to turn on the washing machine and dryer.  I'm a transwoman, so there are a few abnormal things if you think that shaving gel and razors are all that abnormal.<br>
<br>
Listening to RUSH's Vital Signs this morning.  It's wonderful!<br>
<br>
I want to code some software and make some music, duh!  But I have all this other financial stuff stopping me from having enough peace to be able to do it.  So I run around town.  Doing errands on the bus which is a huge time killer.  But I perform my political monolog on the bus and that's pretty neat.  People seem to be mostly impressed and attentive.  I have no idea why they don't contribute.  I've contributed to presidential candidates who did not win before.  Several times.  And I'm certainly in need.  Look around, there are a few others too.  People are just too chicken to give them a few dollars for fear that they will buy some drug or something like a smoke.  Just consider that you may be incorrect and they may be in the market for a kitchen sponge.<br>
<br>
Here is the house I sold and one that I saw on my screen yesterday.  I obviously have no bargaining power in the men's world.<br>

After reading Geddy Lee's book several times, I then started picking up on the idea here too, from this very first sentance (in the Prologue), that I too was named after a relative murdered in a war like activity.  The Korean war.  It might not have been as obvious as this, but uncle Rand being cast into the Puget Sound or ocean by the boom arm of the family sailboat and then my maternal grandfather diving in to save him and both dying.  The resulting trauma on my mother, aunt and grandmother.  My taking after my grandmother as my by far top role model in the family because of her elegant, clean nature.  My transgenderism is based on this.  I work slacks to high school.  The boomers and the slackers.<br>
<br>
"Industrialism had an expiration date stamped on it at the factory." - Ms Rand<br>
<br>
Not even kidding about this.  I'd say it is highly likely that Geddy Lee's and my life have been highly orchestrated to bring this message to you and around the world.<br>
<br>
I kind of feel like Sting is the world leader in all this and Geddy Lee and I are the North American Continent authorities.  Believe me, I've got some odd and interesting stories!<br>
<br>
Rachel (my middle name was Rand, no one ever called me Charles, then hey, it sounds like a good idea to keep Rand as my last name : - )<br></div>

Let me try to do this posting again.  I'm struggling for the right words and message here.<br>
<br>
1. A presidential agrument.  Stating a case.<br>
<br>
<br>
In order to be successful, I need:<br>
<br>
1. Supporters.<br>
2. A good home life.<br>
3. To remain transgender.<br>
<br>
My ideal partner is just what I say she is.  Young and innocent.  I don't want some big intellectual discussion when I get home from talking with world leaders.  Someone who can accept me as transgender.  I have some serious road miles on me, essepcially on my mind.  Someone to love me the way I am.</div><br>
<br>
<br>
It just seems like people would want to be with me.  That some young girl would love to come home with me and I'd show her the music and software I do.  The presidential work.  The computer work.  Cook a meal.  Watch a movie.<br>
<br>
I don't go out.  I don't go out to concerts.  I don't go out to sports.  I don't go out to clubs.  Going out to a dinner and movie just seems so odd to me.  I understand the dinner, part.  I love food.  And that brings up the other problem that I have had like $40 in the last over 6 months.  Like total.  I'm in extreme poverty, but I've made $270,000 in the last 3 years.  Most of it was at athenahealth.  Working with Ben Coate.  You could probably even call them up and ask for Ben and ask about me.  He absolutely knows me extremely well.  He's friggin amazing.<br>
<br>
I'm simply exotic.  I have pictures of two girls I am interested in, but they are not in my environment.  For all I know, those pictures are a hundred years old.  I saw a girl on the bus today who excited me.<br>

Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Q: What was it like growing up in an Atheist household Rachel?<br>
<br>
Well, the only religious training I got was "Religious people are crazy.  Stay away from them!"<br>
<br>
<br>
As an adult, and even in high school, it left me wondering what it is all about?  So, because of my trombone playing, I was involved in playing church gigs.  By the end of my 20's, I had had enough and vowed to never play church gigs again.  In my 30's, my high school music teachers tried pulling me into religion.  It's like "Do they respect my religion at all?"  I don't know.  Are they sharing their religion with me?  Well, I guess.  I don't quite understand it.  I know that I do not feel respected.  I'm not even allowed to use the laundry machines where I live.<br>
<br>
I don't get it.  Perhaps mom was right?  I feel that I have more tolerance than her on it, or at least what she showed to me about herself.  I'm actually fine with other people's religion, but I feel discriminated against.  I see people living in tents.  People dragging leaky empty beer bottles on the bus.<br>
<br>
I don't know what is right or wrong.  It must be some parenting thing or something.  I don't get it and I don't want to be around all these dang churches and bars and stupid stickers all over the place, but advertising is a natural thing in life.  And bullies exist.  I thought that we were more civil than this.<br>
<br>
One common thing about the churches is their saying "Love thy neighbor".  I don't even know what to say about that.  It's some kind of loaded question.  It's all up to you.  You have to do everything yourself.<br>

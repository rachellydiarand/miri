Some people, or even a majority of people, may think that my mission to fill these three positions is a joke, but I'm crazy serious about it.  That research position is dang important to me and the other two are as well.<br>
<br>
It's not a hunt for a romantic partner, but there is that aspect to it as well.  My life is huge and complicated obviously.  I'm likely way different than YOUR next door neighbor.<br>
<br>
The comedy political monolog music show is also a thing.  I'm not interested in becoming the next Johnny Carson with the good 'ol jazz orchestra on the side of the stage.  I mean, is that what it is?  Night after night?  I have NEVER had a vision of my life becoming that.  I never wanted to do live gigs.  I'm sick to death of group music.  There is some desire to interview people like that.<br>
<br>
BUT....<br>
<br>
If this is not about the end of industrialism and the business of that and my business job within it, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT IT.  I'm not an emerging musician like that.  This must be dang huge.  Like me as the Leader of the Free World (the whole world) in the end of Industrialism switch.<br>

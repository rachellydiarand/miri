In October 2020, when I acted on Sting's advice of "getting out of my comfort zone" by answering an ad on CL for a Rush Tribute Band bass player / singer, it was NOT about reinvigorating a professional music career.  I had serious financial problems after my second failed attempt at being elected for US Representative.  I was simply trying to get out of my comfort zone.  I was successful with that and more importantly, I finally learned how to play and sing at the same time which is a wonderful skill.  I practiced hard daily for 6 months then to be able to do that.<br>
<br>
I am a US Presidential Candidate.  I'll either become a US President, a professional political writer, or simply an older retired person.  I keep on getting pestered by secret service commentary of "you're weak".  Whatever.  I'm kind of a George Burns type character physically.  I'm mostly not a smoker, but I may start again if it truely is a health thing.  It feels like salt is trying to leave my body through my lungs and of course that is a bad thing, but it's got to leave some way and I'm not going to be a weight lifter or drink Gatoraide.  These are the kinds of things you get into apparently when you get old.<br></div>

Trying to condense my last post here.  This is further explaination of why I am putting effort into people working with me as part of my preliminary Cabinet:<br>
<br>
1. If I suddenly had lots of political money, I may be flooded with people anxious to get at it.<br>
<br>
2. The presidency iteself is a high stress job.  These three positions are all critical to me.  If I simply bring on a Research Assistant, then that may be adding to my workload because I'll be excited about what we are working on and forgetting to take care of more basic personal health things of cooking, laundry and relaxing.  A personal assistent will help me be aware to take proper breaks.  Kind of like a second set of eyes on my health situation.<br>
<br>
3. The HR/Campaign Manager is also a critical position.  I'm not getting involved much in that now.  I need someone on board to bring other people on board and almost completely handle the campaign/advertising duties because I am now working on the job itself with my cabinet people.  I'm over that campaign stuff.<br>
<br>
4. I'm obviously not a simple musician.  This thing with me <i>could</i> be a simple 2026 Fourth of July music celebration, but I doubt it.  I'm proceeding on with the idea that this is major politics and I will absolutely be heading up as The Leader of the Free World as US President #48.  It's a real position and I'm obviously stacked with some skills with computers, budgets and running a business in multiple industries.<br>
<br>
5. It's still this classic idea of a male/female couple for the Research Assistant / HR positions and a female Personal Assistant for myself (don't think of this as a girlfriend position, virtually all girlfriends are not dating a potential Leader of the Freeworld).  My health is already suffering and having someone on a more domestic side with me to say "Is it time to watch an old movie together Rand?" is absolutely something I need right now.  Someone to watch it all going down and learn some sensitivity about it all and patterns that work for me.<br>
<br>
6. This is an onsite position deal.  4 of us living here ideally.  I'm confident money will start coming in if we are working well together.  That's just kind of how things work at the White House.  If money comes in, we can just buy a mansion or something real quick, right?<br></div>

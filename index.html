Good evening!<br>
<br>
Well, my little medical drama and all this other drama and intesnse work that has been going on for years, I have some emerging different actions to take.<br>
<br>
1. My health situation, the current crisis of it, may just be a UTI.  Perhaps I'll simply go to a doctor now that I have some more insight on that.  I feel, that doctors typically do not know more about your situation than you do.  You can tell them all about it in 20 minutes, but you know, 20 minutes is barely any time at all.  They certainly do have experience and schooling.  Not saying that they are not professionals.  But, for me, with all the medical torture I have been through, I have not felt comfortable going to them until just now.  Now that I have this new insight, I feel like I can deal with them in a more rational way.<br>
<br>
2. The religious/church thing.  Perhaps I can just show up at random church services to break some kind of barrier with them.  I can just tell myself that I only have to go to one service at each place.  They may be happy to see Lydia there no matter what their little denomination is.  Perhaps I don't even have to say hello to anyone or anything at all.  It's not like they will not know it's me.  They are people too.  Never said otherwise.  I operate differently.  At least that is how I feel.  I don't like people trying to convert me.  That would be my #1 reason for just doing one service, and likely even leaving before all the converstations begin, because I'm just not good in groups.<br>

<span class="babyBlue">I think that post industrialism, post capitalism, globablly, we'll end up politically with <u>local democracies</u> and a <u>federal republic</u> which may as well be a federal communism.</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
On the federal side, the side I am running to be in command of, is about distribution of food, clothing and shelter, primarily through the manufacture and transportation, over our interstate freeway system, of the raw materials for those items.  Personal transportation will not allow many to get out of their city anymore.  Essentially no air travel and you'll have to do some heavy lifting working in society to get enough gas to do interstate travel, no matter how much you had in the bank before the ball fell.<br>
<br>
On the housing and infrastruture side, expect roads to be crumbling on a massive scale and eventually be leveled into small rocks with tanks.  That's why all these sidewalks were built.  If you have a monster truck, you'll need to move to more remote locations or we'll be taking your truck from you and giving you something more city appropriate.<br>
<br>
My big role in it will be making these computer systems work for us to redistribute housing and automobiles with that air BnB app type technology and getting rid of Fanny and Freddy Mac.  And HUD.  The SSA is a good tracking mechanism.  USDA/SNAP/EBT (food stamps) will be a critical organiztion which essentially everyone will be using to some extent.<br>
<br>
Local restaurants and food are where that <u>local democracy</u> comes into play.  It'll be like a local currency.  You will all just have to figure it out because it seems compilicated and not a federal issue at all.<br>
<br>
Factories will likely be mostly running 1 day a week or something like that.  No sense in not using them if they still work, although some will obviously just be shut down due to a lack of raw materials and/or need.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the USA is a continent nation type of configuration and there are smaller countries which are more like states throughout the world, so it's a little different in each region.  But for the most part, everything around the world is made of <u>METRO AREAS</u>.  Which may be a reason why the three cylinder car I drove for a decade, the only new car I ever bought, was called a GEO METRO.<br>
<br>
Housing materials are going to slow way down.  Gotta keep the shingles going for the most part, but with your local house, just plan on extending the maintenance work as much as you can.  You'll likely be using your electronic devices to log onto these systems that I may be managing, to order building materials so that you may be put into a priority queue.  That whole thing we have had of being able to walk into a store and buy anything as long as you have the money is not going to work in this system.  That's probably one of the main goals of the AI technology.  To help out with deciding who has the greater need for the constuction essentials.  And housing itself.  And automobiles.<br>
<br>
<u>It's nothing to be scared or frightened of</u>.  It's not like the federal government is coming for your house or car!  Really, it's mostly not that.  It's the same as it always was.  If the government needed to destroy your house to put up a power transfer station, they kicked you out.  Absolutely.  And people would get mad.  Of course.  But, it's just the same like that, but the borders of it are not so cleanly cut and it's all managed directly through these computers and some poeple working at home moderating the whole thing using the fiber optic connections.<br>
<br>
<br>
And, of course, just like I've been saying, REDUCING POPULATION IS <u>CRITICAL</u>.  That's the scary part of this.  All creatures are driven to reproduce.  My main suggestion is the DEATH AFTER BIRTH BILL.  That you will be allowed to kill you newborn flat out in order to reduce population.  Some women/couples may want to go through the birth process just for something to do.  If you don't, you may be forever wondering about it.  Just because we must reduce population, and likely the majority of use want to reduce it without a massive war, doesn't mean we want you to not have sex or get pregnant.  So, that obviously gets really messy socially and there are certainly the churches around to help with all of that becuase they obviously have some role in that throughout history.  Not that I'm advocating going to a church, because you know dam well I will not bee.<br>
<br>
So, be a good city zen and do your part, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
.... starting with sending me a dang contribution/donation check in the mail, cause I am absolutely crazy right now and want to see your name next to mine on the FEC.gov site.<br>

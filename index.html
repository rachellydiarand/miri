Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Bee careful when you send me a check.<br>
<br>
Bee careful when you transport to the bank and ask for a single printed check from your checking acount.<br>
<br>
Bee careful to get my business name correct when you write it on the check "Ms Rand for President".<br>
<br>
Bee careful when purchasing a single letter or check size security envelope from your neighborhood postage store.<br>
<br>
Bee careful to be honest about your name and occupation when filling out the contribution form.<br>
<br>
Bee careful when assembling it and licking the stamp.  I do not want you to get a papercut on your tongue or fingers.<br>
<br>
Bee careful when interacting with the blue mailbox or the postage employee.  I don't want you do make waves or get arrested for disturbing the peace.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance for your efforts.  Your work does not go unnoticed.<br>

A musician can get a feeling that people are consuming their work by holding concerts.<br>
<br>
Actors can get a feeling that people are consuming their work when they get approached on the streets by strangers.<br>
<br>
Presidents and high performing presidential candidates can get a feeling that they are reaching people when people don't ask for their name when they come into a shop but address them directly.<br>

If you ever find yourself in a situation where you are faint and in a hospital or ambulance setting, or appear to be delusional, you'll likely be asked a couple questions.  Almost always, the questions are:<br>
<br>
1.  What year is it?<br>
<br>
2.  Who is president?<br></div>

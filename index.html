Good morning!<br>
<br>
I woke up to doing a little research on "alpha males".  Thinking of those men in that gang bang porn that I enjoy.  Who are they?  I certainly have some different kind of power.<br>
<br>
That secret service type communication when I was on a transport they other day pointed out that I am an athlete.  Yeah, I have some power.  In some ways, I'm stacked with power and other ways there is complete deficit.<br>
<br>
I mean, what would I do with money anyway?  Sure, get a house with some proper ventilation.  A piano, drumset.  Trombone of course.  What does that do for my presidency though?<br>
<br>
Is this place I live "Death Row Records"?  It's been haunting me most of the time I've been here.  I don't fucking care.  If this isn't the presidency, I DO NOT CARE about it.<br>
<br>
So, what is this presidency thing?  Well, it's certainly a war thing.  If you believe any of the war stuff in the news at all.  I'd say that it is highly likely that a lot of it is fake, but who knows?  Those gangbang films are likely not fake at all.  People being publically gangbanged?  Well, I have walked completely naked, all alone on the streets of Portland in 2012.  Is it just a test of attitude?<br>
<br>
I closed out that research when I saw the phrase "seducing women".  Well, I'm certainly way, way above that.  Or perhaps just in a different direction.<br>
<br>
It's the same old story.  The same old trial.  What do you think?  Do you think my story is about my friends accepting me back and us gathering to have a slice of cake and tea?<br>
<br>
Should a get a contract with the porno company?  Should I walk into the musician's union?  Return bottles and cans for $40 so I can get an ActBlue account instead of the Raise the Money Account I currently have?  What do you think?<br>
<br>
Are the "old" people going to give up and start supporting me so I can buy some print advertising and some billboards?  Are they waiting for me to prove myself or to lower my voice or to sign up for corporate sponsorship?  Perhaps they are just laughing at me because I won't eat a banana?<br></div>

<div class="babyBlue"><br>
Good morning!  I'm feeling a tab bit more grounded this morning.  Wow, this work is intellectually challenging.</div><br>
<div class="pink"><br>
I'm enjoying transcribing music lately.<br>
<br>
The political thing seems to be moving along well.  I still desire contributions to assemble this team.  HR, Research Assistant.  I've decided that both can be work from home.  I'll absolutely be insisting on tangible results.  I need this HR person to really take charge with getting other people involved in a way I can see on the streets and in the media.  It verges on campaign manager.  It's a very physical and active position.<br>
<br>
Research Assistant is key.  I am drowning in research and I can't find a damn thing.  I need someone to take charge of my screenshot library so I can find things on demand.  I don't have time to sort it all out.<br>
<br>
Personal assistant is like more of a girlfriend/boyfriend role I suppose.  The introvert AA group idea is still strong with me.  I"m a transwoman.  I may perform as a male in bed, but I'm not changing anything else about my appearance or personality.  Still strong desire for a female partner, I suppose.  I'm just a transwoman.  It makes dating difficult.  I am not an "A" list type of person.  I'm not a party person.  I'm more of a soccer mom type.<br>
<br>
OK, I moved my personal stuff to a rachel.html page on my ms-rand site to try to keep it more business over here.  I'm working on making books, music, audio books and video recordings this winter.  It's going to be an exciting year.</div><br></div>

<br>
Good morning!  How was your sleep?</div>
<br>
<div class="pink">
<br>
People like to talk politics about all kinds of social things.  I get it.  People put a lot of work into all these structures and utilities around here.
<br>

<br>
If we are going to ratchet down industrialism in a non "triangular wave" pattern, like liberty bell curve pattern, then that likely means:
<br>

<br>
1. Decreasing oil refining.  This has to be a linear fashion.  There would be less of every product of the distilation column.
<br>

<br>
2. Likely ending residential natural gas.  I know, this is a bummer.
<br>

<br>
3. Less asphalt.  We may be able to get it straight from "tar sands" in Canada.  I've seen reports about that.  It sounds like they are soaking them in water to extract oil from them currently.  There are some other indicators in my environment about this.
<br>

<br>
4. Abandoning paving some roads.
<br>

<br>
5. Ceasing most new housing construction.
<br>

<br>
6. Limited hardware supplies for remodeling.
<br>

<br>
7. Continued food and clothing of course.  The limiting factor to all of this is that we have to keep diesel gas going for commercial traffic.  And we need gas for people to get to the store and essential workers.
<br>

<br>
8. Limited air travel most likely.
<br>

<br>
9. Online ordering of any new products from the "industrial machine".  Local pickup may be a thing, but it certainly won't be the "browsing the isles" that we have seen for all of eternity.  You'll likely need some kind of online authorization.  Electric Amazon trucks aren't massively dependent on the distilation column, right?
<br>

<br>

<br>
As you can see, if this is happening, this is a MAJOR world change.  Population decline goes along with this.  We essentially took all the good oil, bananas, rubber and other exotic products from those highly productive areas of the planet and moved them around.  This depleated top soil in all those regions which reduces output of any new products.  We have this problem everywhere.
<br>

<br>
Population decline is key and my transgenderism isn't really a WAY TO DECREASE POPULATION.  Ya know?  It's just my style of living folks.  Yeah, I do this loopy music thing.  But I do politics for a living.  I haven't made money at it yet, but it's likely going to happen here soon.  I sure hope it is, cause wow, I have put a lot of work into this and if you only knew all the signals I am getting from my life of training.  It is blinding weirdness these stories of my life.
<br>

<br>
Fun stuff too though!  It looks like Sting is having some fun!  Hey, I'm a different person, right?  Go a little easy on me.  I am a torture victim.
<br>

<br>
OK, scones came out of the oven!  Thank you John Kanell!
<br>

<br>
10. Shoe rubber.  Whether is is latex or a distalation column product, this stuff was good for running and better than those leather shoes.  Perhaps the marijuana thing is for those groovy hemp wedge sandal heels?  And welcome mats?  It's also good for incense.

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.
<br>

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.  That is my opinion on my professional life.</span>

I keep on musing on the Radar character on M*A*S*H.  Perhaps that is the only male role model I have in life?  Not that I'm looking for a male role model at all.  I'm sick to death of male music role models and was never into sports.  Radar just makes sense to me like that.
<br>

<br>
But you know.  I do me and you do you.  It's best like that.</div>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.
<br>

<br>
Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

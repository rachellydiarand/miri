<b>I sill have not received an official campaign contribution.</b>  My interpretation of where this is headed is that I'm just waiting for write in votes against Sen. Jeff Merkley on May 19th.  The idea is so bizare that it makes sense that I don't even have to do any more shoe leather campaigning.</span><br>
<span class="pink"><br>
The relationship thing is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
The thing with my ex's, including Marge, is ridiculous.  Marge is likely a lawyer who I will be able to appoint to the Supreme Court to help this thing with the Death After Birth bill.<br>
<br>
My playing music, the pressure to go to bars, hunt down open mic opportunities, engage the workers/owners/management at coffee shops.  That doesn't make any sense to me.<br>
<br>
I'm simply waiting for votes.  Politicians don't typically get cheers.  Not like musicians do.  There is the Sting shame lyric "You could say I, lost my faith in our politiicians.  They all seemed like, game show hosts to me."  Well, I interpret that, and all of this done to me, as a way to keep others from doing what I did and to train me to do this super big job.  I do not see it as a game show position or a master of ceremonies position.  I interpret my position as being the lead, in the commander in chief role, of making an entirely new monetary system.  It's not bitcoin, it isn't printed bills and it isn't much of a democratic system.  Sorry if that rubs you the wrong way.  I don't think anything else can be done.  The 20% of people who are still working in the future get first dibbs on housing, cars and gas.  If you are not working, your place and car may be confiscated in a similar manner to how the government took people's houses to build freeways and other things.<br>

One of the best friends I ever had was Nate.  He was my bicycling partner in the early to mid 1990's in Memphis Tennessee.  He was like 18 years old and had just joined the Navy.  I was married to Ann.  No children.  I was like 24 and 25.<br>
<br>
I don't recall ever going to a bar with Nate.  It could be that he was simply underage, but the thing I remember that is significant is that the thought never even occured to me.  We enjoyed bicycling together.  We didn't even play music together!</span><br>

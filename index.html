Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Because of our president's name, TRUMP, and my dad's background of taking us, my brother and I, to the MGM Grand hotel in Reno Nevada, essentially yearly.  And the card playing/gambling in high school.  And that same kind of thing, in ALL ASPECTS of my life, is pure insanity for me.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what is going on.  People often say that they hate the current regime.  That anyone would be better.  And I'm in the race, high ranking in the race in many ways.  And no one will step up to donate/contribute.  At all.<br>
<br>
It's pure insanity.  Sitting in the mental hospital will not help this.  The only thing that will help.  THE ONLY THING, is people "coming out" to support me.  By writing me a check and filling out a contribution form with their full name, address, occupation and employer.<br>
<br>
If YOU are calling me weak, then well, I feel the same way.  Are we together?  Will you join me?  Are you willing to put skin in the game like I have?  There is NO DENYING that I have skin in the game.  How about you?<br>

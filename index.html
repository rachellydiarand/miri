Look, I don't know where the "push-back" on my ideas is coming from, but it exists.  Is it simply guilty feelings from not being a hard-core physical worker?  Is it an inferiority complex of having my first career as a underappreciated acid jazz non-conforming trombone soloist?  Is it an internal AI type routine?  Secret service?  Common peer pressure?<br>
<br>
Are people just radically against my transgenderism?<br>
<br>
Uh, the most distressing part is my search for a girlfriend mixed with a need for a personal assistant.<br>
<br>
But when it all comes down to the root of it, I'm a presidential candidate with an IRS employeer number who wants to assemble a work team.  I'm glad this isn't my Dot Trombone software business.  I've taken the lead with it being all presidential over here.  If money come pouring in, I can only assume that will open the flood gates of people wanting some of it.  How would that work?<br>
<br>
Well, I guess I want to keep my team fairly small, especially at the beginning.  I'm asking for 3 positions.  People typically answer job ads.  The boss doesn't typically seek out every last employee.  Someone step up already.  Someone youngish ideally.  The thought a couple hours ago was of it evolving fairly quickly to a touring scene where we are going from place to place and into businesses with the idea that I am a gateway to this Gen Z thing and I'm showing you our industrial processes AND places that YOU'LL be inheriting when we are all gone.  The idea is that I'm a big, big part of radically changing our economy and especially money system, but you know, we are going to want to keep working and making stuff.  It's just a matter of what and where and how.  We'll have to cut a lot of stuff out but keep some stuff.<br>
<br>
So I need a researcher or small research team (the cabinet) to sort through MY IDEAS of what we have in the world and brainstorm together and what is necessary and what is not so necessary.  It's going to take some work.  If you have worked on this in college and think you have it all figured out, that's great.  Sign up and I'll work on getting you back into beginner's mind so we can see it all from a different angle.  I don't really trust what you have learned in college.  It's nice and all and I'm sure very useful, but I work on more of a zen, hands on level and it's not going to be a thing of working 8 hour shifts in factories.  For me personally or my cabinet team.<br>
<br>
As far as the campaign staff goes, it's kinda comedy on that level.  I have a ton of experience with it all.  Hopefully you have some good ideas and gumption to make some things happen.  I can talk with you about all the things I have tried and what is good and bad about each one.  I don't want to be super involved in campaigning anymore.  If you make progress and have some event you want me to speak at, then arrange the transportation and I'll grab the stage microphone and some preamp kinda stuff and we'll go do it.  I don't have a projector for the computer, that'll be on you if you want that end of it or I put up a hissy fit and say I WILL BE NEEDING A PROJECTOR FOR THIS ONE.<br>
<br>
I realized two days ago the connection between "one and one and one is three" and my little 2002 u111 matrix site.  Every day seems like that.  I can't friggin believe it.  I mean, I know I was hogging symbols and all but wow, this stuff goes back to my first memory and I certainly didn't plan that!<br>
<br>
I'm not all that anti-teamwork of course.  It's figgin' stupid though for me to walk in a club pertending I'm some average person trying to fight my way into an open mic slot.  Make me barf already!  Do you know how many decades I've delt with that crap?  Not doing it that way.  Be my assistent, hold my hand into the club and tell me when my slot is.  I'm friggin terrible at taking cash at the door and in between sets I have no idea what other people are doing because I'm just being totally akward in a corner somewhere or in a group of people looking like I'm not alone in a corner somewhere but really just still alone in a corner somewhere because I just don't get it at all.<br>
<br>
dig?<br>
<br>
<br>
You can make fun of me being like all business, but I enjoy that more than whatever weird social thing people have going on.  Maybe I'm just an old rat race person?  I don't care about how productive what I'm doing is on the big scale.  I do my processes here like it matters, big time.  If it never gets used, not a big deal.  I'm at the ready and stronger for the next similar project.<br>
<br>
I likely can't go around the whole world finding all the answers myself, so of course there is some element of trust.  But I'm an engineer, so I essentially only trust in the god of mathematics.  So, we're not perfect and I have my little processes that I trust and I try to expand that bubble of trust as big as I can.  Trying to expand it out to a couple of people.  It's kind of a teaching thing and then kinda not.  I certainly want some young people to learn my zen ways and processes close up.  If you are passionate about any of this world and business stuff, then let's dig into this data and see what we can figure out.<br>
<br>
You see, even filling this one Research position will likely totally ramp me up mentally.  So that brings in a growing need for the Personal Assistant position.  Reminding me to take some breaks and watch an old movie 'cause my mental thing just can't take the stimulation of a new movie.  It's like, yes, these old movies trigger massive new thinking about them, but with most of them, I know the dialog so the thinking is actually pretty calming.  It would be good if you had some interest in watching these older things with me and not pushing anything big on me.  My mental state is just really odd and my stress and torture level is high.  I'm doing pretty good with it all things considered.<br>
<br>
<br>
you know, it's unlikely that a 28 year old famous musician has the mental thing going on quite the same way that I have it going on.  If you count the Czech Republic as an Asian country, then I played music on 5 continents before I was 29 years old and got paid $150,000 for it.  And then I said to hell with that and wound up sleeping on the ground or hard as ground surfaces for 1,200 nights while I was studying math and computer stuff.  I assume that famous musicians are concentrating more on their next music project or their family.  I do my 4 little songs a year.  My family was way more political and geek than music.  And certainly toxic geek masculine and feminist.<br>
<br>
ok, moving on to trying to get a little more rest.  It's really all very stressful doing this all alone, but it's just not going to be a thing of the political party coming into my living room saying they have my back because I am actually the leader of it.  It's weird like that and it means that it comes down to YOU, if you have the right skills to help and are nearby because the Personal Assistant AND Research Assistant are both in person, hopefully on site jobs.  Just think of it like being in the White House.  You <i>can</i> get in your car and go home, but this is the white house gig with the cabinet and all that and not me communting to the club.<br>

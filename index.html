Look, it's easy to criticize me.  Like saying that my work isn't valid.  But that software work that I did, as a contractor, running my own business with all that comes with being a business owner, it was excellent presidential training.<br>
<br>
My whole life has been excellent presidential training.<br>
<br>
I am a business professional.  I excel at some parts of the business more than others.  It's disturbing to know that extreme poverty and sexual discrimination are part of my training to be president.  It's like, OK, I am gay.  I act gay.  Always have.  I'm a transwoman through and through.  I'm stacked with computer knowledge to help us get into this new economy.  My music and zen skills are fun.  It's easy to critisize me for not being a party type person.  Like people thinking I'm all business.  I look party but I'm all business.<br>
<br>
Lots of labels.  I'm completely stressed out by it all.  It's not fun having no money at all in a capitalist society.  Are people treating me like a transwoman or are they treating me as a woman?  I don't know.<br>
<br>
I got triggered by a picture of Sting today.  Like on stage, with a bald head, doing his rock star thing.  Hey, I'm different, right?  He's been doing that since his 20's.  I'm a trombonist.  I played a bunch of stupid ceremonial music for a living.  Standing at attention.  It's more like a Royal Guard job than a musician job sometimes.  And that was decades ago.  And nothing, nothing significant has happened in Portland musically for me.<br>
<br>
I am all business.<br>
<br>
An all business transwoman musican software engineer.  I'm just different.  I'm scared.  I'm really scared and tortured by it all.  But that doesn't mean I would be a bad president.<br>
<br>
So I work the problem.  I do my job as I see it every day.  There is a good chance that things will turn around here.  The main lesson last week is that we are likely stopping political mailing, forever.  Not so sure about gathering at the poles.  I still like the idea of mailed ballots and the drop boxes.  That isn't really my call.<br>
<br>
Money in politics usually means mailings.  Transportation.  Rubber.  We've got some serious problems and changes coming up.  I deserve to be paid for my work now.  I deserve to have money to hire a small staff/team.  I have enough skin in the game.  I have enough training.<br></div>

<div class="pink"><br>
This whole situation I'm in reminds me of how I got into professional music and professional software engineering.  It just took years and years of self-eduction and in the final year or two before getting that first job, there was so much pressure to just give up on it.  Everyone telling me that it is not working.  But then it worked out both times.<br>
<br>
This one may not.  I mean, this is like one of the biggest jobs in the world.  I'm just here doing my work on the project.<br>

<b>Hopefully</b> <span class="pink">these days of the character assassination type training will end.  That real money will get inserted into my political campaigning efforts so that I may LEARN to be the type of business person who can hire employees.  I have never had the opportunity to hire full time employees or to significantly manage anyone.
<br>

<br>
I'm not a huge fan of being a manager.  I'm kind of a stand alone artist and worker.  An artisan.  But yes, I desire to hire and manage a small team.  Just like I am saying.  And to do my solo music/comedy/political show.  That's what I do.
<br>

<br>
I saw a picture of Kamala Harris years ago at a podium in a high school gym with people on the sides of the room on the benches.  Her, all alone, in the middle, with lots of space around.  She is/was an executive level federal politician.  That's definitely the gig I am working towards.  That is what I do and am trained to do.  This is not a put a band together gig.  That is my opinion on my professional life.</span>

I keep on musing on the Radar character on M*A*S*H.  Perhaps that is the only male role model I have in life?  Not that I'm looking for a male role model at all.  I'm sick to death of male music role models and was never into sports.  Radar just makes sense to me like that.
<br>

<br>
But you know.  I do me and you do you.  It's best like that.</div>

I am doing this political job, right?
<br>

<br>
I mean, there are other people.  I could be an entertainer.  Right now I'm in search of people being more kind to me and my housing situation and obtaining $200/month for those "extras" that make me feel human.  Like kitchen sponges, TP and of course some clothing items.
<br>

<br>
Sorry, that's a bit of my insanity thread, but is what I have going on.</div>

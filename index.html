Look, that idea of the Jiffy Lube or mattress store sign wavers is probably OK, but this putting signs on the poles is NOT OK.  I had some people a couple years ago saying they would do this type of advertising for me, but I avoided it because I don't believe in it.  I may take pictures of all these signs and petition the city to prosecute them.  It's litter and bad for the poles not to mention a huge negative trigger for some people.

I have no idea why people enjoy music and TV in restaurants.  It destroys the intimacy and romance.  I certainly have intimacy and romance in my dining room most of the time and that is where I prefer to spend the majority of MY TIME.

If people are leaving trash all around me because they think I am a trashy transwoman, then please, please send me a note and buy my book.  I really don't want to be out on the streets anyway.

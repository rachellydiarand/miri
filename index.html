Please address me.  I'm the main attraction on some level, right?

Good morning!  How was your sleep?<br>
<br>
I've been keeping my normal erratic presidential schedule, but I'm doing more monolog which works up to a political philosophy and even platform point, opinion and action.  And I've been posting that mostly on TransgenderPulse.com.  They are really good over there with the strong back and forth politics.  Much more so than reddit, or at least the places I have been on reddit.  Reddit is excellent though, just not so great on that level of politics.  I've found a lot more of the typical dissenting politics over on reddit.  Things are good over there too though.  Lots of good writing action happening around me, so work is good like that.<br>
<br>
I'm coming into my own for realizing that I am effectively allergic to bars, taverns, men's spaces and churches, in much the same way an alcoholic develops an allergy to alcohol.  Because of my upbringing no doubt.  So I'm reclaiming the religion of my youth because of that.  I'm an Atheist.  Kind of an agnostic atheist.  Like my dad on that level.<br>
<br>
I've declared that the only way I can feel good at a bar/tavern/pub that is more than a quaint restaurant, is to go as a man's date.  Like taking a woman on a date, even as an openly lesbian couple, doesn't really work for me.  As a man's date, I would be expecting him to treat me as his lady.  In a traditional way.  To introduce me to people directly.  "This is Rachel."  To handle those transactions.  I'm his eye candy of sorts.  I'm interested in being with him, not really the place.<br>
<br>
I never went into a bar or tavern with Adrianna, Patty or Cynthia.  I never had a drink of alcohol with any of them.  And they were my three best romantic relationships.  Just saying that a female partner with me does work.  It's really the bars and men's spaces that do not work.  And the churches.  I physically resigned from my kinda official church membership.  It seems all good with them.  I'm officially changing my religion now from Zen to Atheist as it is the most respectful thing to do since I do not claim Buddhism.<br>
<br>
My Sex (on my id) is Female.  I am typically allowed in Feminine only identifying spaces.<br>
<br>
My sexuality is bisexual.  I'm a romantic and enjoy traditional romantic, committed relationships.  That's why I don't got to strip clubs.  I'm not one of the "guys going together to a strip club".  Or bar for that matter.  It's offensive for me to "go out with the guys".  The last several times I have gone out with my lifelong best friend, I have considered myself his date, whether we declare that amoungst ourselves or not.<br>
<br>
I consider the intent of an "X" marker in the sex field of an ID to be a declaration of either Androgonous or Questioning.  Or I suppose Queer.  I claim Female.  I still feel male enough to perform as a US President, but yeah, I do toe the line on that.  I feel I'm a perfect representative of both women and men on that front.  And so many of our world cultures that I'm just completely ridiculous.<br>
<br>
It's fabulous living like this, even with all the hardship.  My place is fairly spacious and warm this morning.  Wearing a nice mini sweater dress and feminine tights.  Feeling good!  Hope you are well too!<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
Rachel</span><br></div>

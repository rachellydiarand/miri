That's pure trigonometry, right?  It's not linear algebra and it's not calculus.  A to B, different degreees.  Or radians.<br>
<br>
It's a difficult morning for some reason.  Is this whole city, or even whole world, lying to me?  If so, how to get them to stop?  Or do I want them to stop?  What does it even mean at all?  Why?<br>
<br>
So, I wait for an election.  For more than 100,000 write in votes.  It feels like I am that well known and supported.  I'm looking forward to the change.</span><br>
<br>
It's the middle of winter.  I've been running around to all these help agencies.  People in their little job positions.  Lines of cars at 8am.<br>

With this population decline idea and the 80% unemployment....  It's not really about conserving resources.  We likely have to do it because we are running out of something critical, but it is more about getting the population lower than sizing our industrial output to the population decline.<br>
<br>
It's a complicated equation.  ( working out better wording here.... )<br>
<br>
It's like we've been building up for the future, but now that is done.  On one level, it becomes the question of "Is it worth it to continue the rat race if it is just going to end anyway in 20 years?"  It's like we would get little more out of it than just the rat race itself.<br>
<br>
Is there another key argument to do it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, I suppose there is the concept that if we do "shut off the gas", then everyone who is an adult will know that we are doing something major.  Even the 20 year olds will be able to understand it because we can just explain that you can look around at all this massive amount of stuff and imagine how much work went into it all and now we are just shutting it off, permanently, and it's because we have run out of something, actually a few things, that are not sustainable and this is likely the peak of humanity.  It's not a hard concept to grasp.<br>
<br>
The hard part about it is realizing that we need to do it now and not in 20 years.  It's pretty much unknowable by any individual.  I guess there are a few people who are certain about it, but that isn't me.  I certainly have massive amounts of ultra-famous muscians and counter-cultural 60's people who I am underground connected to and wow, yeah, it's a big deal in my life.  But I haven't reviewed the natural resources myself.  I'm a master at the delusional end of it.  The delusional nature of language itself from a zen meditation perspective.  From my time on the streets.  In the Navy music thing.  Software engineering.  Writing.  Having massive music skills and no fans or money.  Sustained, extreme poverty and then working up to owning a nice house.  Wireless communications.  Writing protocols.  Math.<br>
<br>
Relationships.<br>
<br>
Death.  I'm certainly experienced.  I know what to do in DC.  The executive level.  Commander in Chief.  Food/Clothing/Shelter.  I've got my own eccentric culture to share too.  We're crazy diverse beings.<br>
<br>
I'm fully convinced that the Earth is headed away from the sun.  And that the planet will cool.  The poles got cold because the planet wasn't doing the seasonal tilt because the moon was small.  So it is more moderate now.  Stopping so much burning is likely going to make the planet colder.  Not sure what it will do to the rain situation.<br>
<br>
It's likely every solar system out there is very similar to ours.  Highly likely that every one of them has life like we do and there is simply no way to send a signal because of the angles of it and the brightness of a sun.  It's highly likely that those pictures of solar things are just fantasies.  Stars are extremely small because they are so far away.<br>
